# agentistics CLI — `agentop`

`agentop` is the single binary for everything agentistics does: run the dashboard,
the terminal TUI, the OpenTelemetry daemon, host or join a **Team Mode** central,
and manage autostart + updates.

Get the binary from the [install instructions](../README.md#install) (`install.sh`,
the Windows installer, or `bun run build:binary` from source). From a checkout you
can also run it directly with `bun run packages/server/bin/cli.ts <command>`.

```bash
agentop --help       # full usage
agentop --version    # print version (and a notice if an update exists)
```

> **Ports:** a solo/member instance serves the **web dashboard on 47292** (the URL you open) and
> the **api + mcp on 47291** (in dev, Vite serves the web on 47292 and the api runs on 47291 — same split).
> A Team Mode **central** runs in Docker on **48080**
> by default. These are intentionally distinct so a member and a central can
> coexist on the same host.

## Command overview

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [`start`](#start) | The control center — services, setup, logs, commands, help (same as bare `agentop`) |
| [`setup`](#setup) | Interactive first-run wizard (solo / central / member) |
| [`server`](#server) | Start the web dashboard + api + Nay + background daemon (non-interactive) |
| [`restart`](#restart) | Restart a running mode so it picks up new code / config |
| [`status`](#status) | At-a-glance: mode, services (server/central/machine) + health |
| [`tui`](#tui) | Live terminal dashboard (no browser) |
| [`watch`](#watch) | OpenTelemetry metrics daemon only (headless) |
| [`central`](#central) | Manage the Team Mode central (wraps `central.sh`) |
| [`member`](#member) | Join / leave / inspect a Team Mode central from this machine |
| [`session`](#session) | Start / list / attach / kill background assistant sessions (tmux-backed); `ls` prints the cockpit's table |
| [`ci-push`](#ci-push) | One-shot push of a GitHub Actions run's metrics to a central (per repo) |
| [`autostart`](#autostart) | Start a mode with the system (systemd user service) |
| [`upgrade`](#upgrade) | Upgrade `agentop` to the latest release |
| [`check-update`](#check-update) | Print an "update available" banner, else stay silent |
| [`doctor`](#doctor) | Run the exposure preflight before publishing a central |
| [`setup-token`](#setup-token) | Reissue a central's one-time owner setup token |
| [`reset-password`](#reset-password) | Reset an account's password from the host (locked-out owner) |

Running **bare `agentop`** on an interactive terminal opens the
[control center](#start). Without a terminal it prints this help; `--help` always prints it.

---

## `start`

The **control center** — one full-screen application, in the terminal's *alternate buffer*, so it
adds nothing to your scrollback no matter how long you use it. Bare `agentop` opens the same thing.

```bash
agentop                      # the usual way in
agentop start
agentop start --lang pt      # force Portuguese for this run
```

 q quit  ·  ←→ screens  ·  tab pane  ·  ↑↓ move  ·  enter actions  ·  s stop  ·  R restart
```

**Naming:** `agentistics` is the per-machine app; `agentistics central` is the team aggregator.
Both serve a web dashboard, so neither is labelled "the dashboard".

### The screens

Move between them with **`←` / `→`** — there are no digit shortcuts for screens, so the digits
always belong to whatever list is drawing them.

| Screen | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **services** | The cockpit: start / stop / restart, connect to or leave a central, enable a boot service |
| **setup** | The same solo / central / member wizard as [`setup`](#setup), plus the history-preservation consent |
| **logs** | A tailing viewer, one source per running service |
| **commands** | The cheat sheet — every command, without leaving the app |
| **help** · **contribute** | What the keys do, and how to contribute |

### The services screen

The services list is the **selection**; the pane below is a view *of* it, so moving the cursor
repaints it. `tab` cycles the panes (services → config → actions) and the actions are
**focus-scoped**: with a service selected they act on *that* service, which is why there is no
"stop which?" submenu.

- **One row per logical service, never per runtime.** `agentistics` run natively and the same
  program in a container are two *runtimes* of one service. A running service therefore offers no
  "start" at all — it offers **Restart**, **Rebuild & restart** (only where a rebuild could actually
  work here), **Stop** and **Open in browser**. A stopped one is dimmed and offers only the starts
  this machine can perform.
- **A service running under BOTH runtimes says so**, in colour, with a word — and its verbs split
  into `Stop (native)` / `Stop (docker)`. They read the same files and fight over the same port, so
  the conflict is never normalised away by showing just one.
- **A long action streams into the detail pane**, titled with the verb you pressed, while the lists
  stay standing beside it. `esc` puts the facts back.
- The **Docker** option mounts the host's harness dirs read-only — run the machine in Docker **or**
  natively, not both. See [Machine in Docker](DEPLOY.md#machine-in-docker).

The footer always names the keys that work *in the current focus*; it is the only documentation the
screen has, so a hint for a key that does nothing there is a bug.

**Non-interactive stdin** (a pipe, a systemd unit) skips all of this and behaves exactly like
[`server`](#server). `q` leaves without starting anything.

---

## `restart`

Restart a running mode so it picks up new code (after an `upgrade` / `git pull`) or a changed
config. Defaults to `server`.

```bash
agentop restart                      # = restart server
agentop restart server               # bounce the systemd user service (agentop-server)
agentop restart watch                # bounce the watch service
agentop restart central              # bounce the central's container
agentop restart --all                # bounce every service currently up
agentop restart central --rebuild    # rebuild the image first, then restart
agentop restart central --rebuild --cache -n   # …reusing the layer cache, answering the prompt
```

`server`/`watch` bounce the installed [systemd user service](#autostart) — if none is installed it
tells you to run it in the foreground or enable autostart first. `--all` bounces everything that is
up (local + central + machine), non-interactively.

**`--rebuild` is a FULL rebuild.** The Docker paths pass `--no-cache`, because a cached build can
hand you back the very image it was asked to replace — which is the one failure mode a rebuild
exists to prevent. That takes several minutes, and the command says so on the way in:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--cache` | Reuse Docker's layer cache instead — the fast path |
| `--no-cache` | The default for a rebuild; stated explicitly |
| `-y` / `--yes` | Re-run the central's interactive setup, without being asked |
| `-n` / `--no` | Do **not** re-run it — the default when there is no terminal to ask on |

Passing `-y` with `-n` (or `--cache` with `--no-cache`) is **refused**, not silently resolved. A
plain `agentop central up` is not a rebuild and keeps its cached build.

---

## `status`

Non-interactive, at-a-glance report of this machine. Prints three blocks:

- **CONFIG** — the team mode (`solo` / `central` / `member`) and, for a member, the
  central endpoint (from preferences).
- **SERVICES** — detected live: the local server (`http://localhost:47291/api/health`;
  shows the dashboard URL when up), the central container, and the machine container.
- **HEALTH** — a one-line summary from `/api/health` when the server is up, else `n/a`.

```bash
agentop status
```

Handy for a quick "is everything up and healthy?" without opening the dashboard.

---

## `setup`

Interactive first-run wizard. Walks you through picking a mode and wires up the
rest for you: **solo** (local only, nothing leaves the machine), **central** (host
the aggregator on this machine via `central.sh init`), or **member** (push this
machine's computed metrics to a central via `member connect`). It then offers to
enable [autostart](#autostart).

```bash
agentop setup
```

Needs a TTY. Ctrl-C is non-destructive — it aborts without touching your
preferences. For non-interactive/scripted member onboarding, use
[`agentop member connect`](#member) directly.

---

## `server`

Starts the web dashboard, api, Nay chat, MCP registration, and the OTel daemon —
everything in one process. Binds two ports: the **web dashboard on 47292** (open this) and the
**api + mcp on 47291**. They share one request handler, so the dashboard's `/api/*` calls just work.

```bash
agentop server              # web: http://localhost:47292 · api/mcp: http://localhost:47291
agentop server --port 4000  # api on 4000, web on 4001
agentop server --bg         # detached, logging to ~/.agentistics
agentop server --central    # run a central natively, no Docker
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port <n>` | `47291` | The **api + mcp** port; the web dashboard is served on this + 1 (default 47292) |
| `--bg` | off | Start detached in the background; logs go to `~/.agentistics` |
| `--central` | off | Run this process as a **team central**, natively — see below |

### `--central` — a central without Docker

Runs the same server with `AGENTISTICS_TEAM_CENTRAL=1`, loading `central.env` (searched in
`$AGENTISTICS_CENTRAL_ENV`, `./central.env`, then `~/.agentistics/central.env`) for the secrets and
the database URL.

There is **no bundled MongoDB on this path** — set `MONGO_URL` to an external cluster (Atlas, or a
`mongod` you run yourself). For the all-in-one flow with Mongo included, use
[`agentop central up`](#central) instead.

> **`AGENTISTICS_TEAM_PASSWORD` in `central.env` selects the legacy shared-password login and masks
> the accounts sign-in.** If you want accounts, remove it — the central will otherwise serve the old
> "team password" screen with no error anywhere.

---

## `tui`

A live multi-screen dashboard in the terminal — no browser needed. Built with
[Ink](https://term.ink), it updates the instant the web dashboard does, over the same
`/api/events` SSE stream.

```bash
agentop tui
agentop tui --lang pt         # force Portuguese for this run
```

| Key | Does |
|-----|------|
| `1`–`5`, `tab` | Switch screen — Overview, Projects, Sessions, Costs, Harnesses |
| `f` | Filter by harness |
| `r` | Force a refresh |
| `?` | Keyboard help |
| `q`, `ctrl+c` | Quit |

There is no configuration wizard — it opens straight into Overview and filtering happens in-app.
If no server is listening it starts one itself and stops it again on exit; a server that was
already running is left alone.

Metrics match the web dashboard exactly: both price through `calcCost()`, Claude totals come from
`stats-cache.json` and every other harness from per-session sums. A metric a harness cannot
produce shows `N/A` rather than a misleading `0`.

Needs an interactive terminal — piping it exits with a message instead of a crash.

---

## `watch`

Runs only the OpenTelemetry file watcher + OTLP metrics exporter (the same daemon
`server` runs in the background). Use this on a headless box that only needs to
feed Grafana/Datadog. See [docs/opentelemetry.md](opentelemetry.md).

```bash
agentop watch
```

---

## `central`

Manage the **Team Mode central** — the Docker service that aggregates metrics from
many members. This is a thin wrapper over the repo's `central.sh`, so it needs to
run from an agentistics checkout (the compiled binary alone doesn't ship the
Compose stack). Full deployment details live in [docs/DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

```bash
agentop central <up|init|down|logs|status|restart|pull>
```

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `init` | (Re)generate `central.env` interactively — auto-generates the secrets with `openssl`, detects your Tailscale IP for the bind, writes the file `chmod 600` |
| `up` | Build the image and (re)create the containers (`--build --force-recreate`); offers `init` first if `central.env` is missing |
| `restart` | Restart the `app` container without rebuilding |
| `logs` | Follow the `app` container logs |
| `status` | Show container + health status |
| `down` | Stop and remove the containers — **keeps** the Mongo data volume |
| `pull` | Rebuild from a fresh base image (run `git pull` first) |

```bash
agentop central init        # generate central.env (interactive)
agentop central up          # build + (re)create — most common
agentop central logs        # tail the app logs
agentop central down        # stop, keep the data volume
```

From a checkout you can equivalently use the package scripts
`bun run init:central` and `bun run up:central`, or call `./central.sh` directly.

---

## `member`

Configure this machine as a **member** that pushes computed metrics to a central.
Only aggregated metrics are sent — **never** chat content or raw transcripts. The
machine's display name is assigned by the central (baked into the minted token)
and resolved via `/api/team/whoami`; there is no name field on the machine.

```bash
agentop member connect --endpoint <url> --token <token> [--org <org>]
agentop member leave
agentop member status
```

### `member connect`

Verifies the token against the central's `whoami` endpoint, then saves the member
config. On a bad token it prints an actionable error and writes **nothing** (no
half-configured state).

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--endpoint <url>` | yes | Central base url, e.g. `http://host:48080` |
| `--token <token>` | yes | Token minted for this machine in the central's Team Manager |
| `--org <org>` | no | Org override; defaults to the org on the token |

```bash
agentop member connect --endpoint http://100.64.0.2:48080 --token abc123
```

### `member leave`

Best-effort notifies the central (so it drops this member's data) and resets this
machine back to solo. Succeeds locally even if the central is unreachable.

### `member status`

Prints the current mode / endpoint / org / user plus the live uploader state
(`last sync` timestamp and whether the token/endpoint are healthy).

```
mode:      member
endpoint:  http://100.64.0.2:48080
org:       default
user:      alice-laptop
last sync: 2026-07-01T12:34:56.000Z
state:     ok
```

---

## `session`

Start, list, attach to, name and stop assistant sessions in the background. A background session is
hosted by tmux on its own socket (`-L agentop`), so it survives `agentop` exiting and never mixes
with your own tmux sessions.

```bash
agentop session <harness> [-p "prompt"] [--bg] [--model <id>] [--effort <level>] [--cwd <path>] [--name "label"] [--task "<name>"]
agentop session ls     [--all] [--group repo|project|task|harness|model|none] [--json] [--width <n>] [--no-color]
agentop session list   [--json]
agentop session attach <id|name>
agentop session kill   <id|name>
agentop session rename <id|name> "label"
agentop session note   <id|name> "text"

# several at once, filed under one task — the form an assistant should drive
agentop session batch --task "<name>" [--cwd <path>] --session "<harness>: <prompt>" [--session ...] [--json]
agentop session open  "<task>" [--json]
```

### `ls` — the cockpit's table, printed

`agentop session ls` prints the very table the control center's **sessions** tab draws: aligned
columns, a section per project, and the state word first. By default it answers the question a
person means by "what have I got open" — **only what is running**, grouped by project:

```
  id     state         session                     worktree         task                 harness  project

```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--all`, `-a` | Also list what is **not** running: finished, lost and closed conversations |
| `--group`, `-g` | `project` (default), `repo`, `task`, `harness`, `model`, `none` |
| `--json` | The same JSON `list --json` prints — one machine-readable shape, not two |
| `--width <n>` | Fit this many columns instead of asking the terminal |
| `COLUMNS` (env) | Read **only when stdout is not a tty** — how wide the reader is when there is no terminal to ask (`ls \| less -S`) |
| `--no-color` | Never colour, whatever the terminal says (`NO_COLOR` does the same) |

It is a **separate command from `list`**, not a flag on it: `list` is the tab-separated dump scripts
already read line by line, and widening it into columns underneath them would break those scripts
for a cosmetic reason. Both print the same `--json`.

Some particulars, all of them shared with the cockpit rather than re-decided here:

- **A session running outside agentop counts as running.** It is listed as `external` because
  `/proc` found a live assistant; what cannot be read there is its *activity*, never whether it is
  alive. It carries no id, because `agentop session attach` cannot resolve one for it.
- **An absent number is absent.** A conversation that recorded no usage shows no usage — the column
  does not exist unless something on screen fills it, and a `0` would be a confident wrong figure.
- **An empty list says why.** "Nothing is running" names the flag that lists the rest; a poll that
  failed says so and never claims the machine is idle.
- **Nothing exceeds the width.** Columns are measured across the page and the row is clipped as a
  last resort, so a narrow terminal loses cells rather than wrapping every row onto the next.
- **Piped output is plain.** No colour, no escapes, and no invented terminal width — the table comes
  out as wide as its content, so `agentop session ls | grep` works.
- **A pipe can still state a width**, and a pager is a reader: with no tty to ask,
  `COLUMNS=80 agentop session ls | less -S` fits 80 columns, the same lever `git` and `ls` honour.
  The order is `--width` → the terminal → `COLUMNS` → as wide as the content; a `COLUMNS` that is
  not a width (`abc`, `0`) is ignored rather than obeyed, and no minimum is imposed on one that is.

`--bg` detaches and returns immediately; without it the session takes over your terminal, and the
detach keystroke is printed first (read from your own tmux prefix, never assumed to be `Ctrl-b`).
`--cwd` defaults to the directory you are in and is resolved to an absolute path.

`batch` starts every session detached and files them all under one task; `open` brings that whole
task back later — safe to press twice, since a session still running is left alone rather than
duplicated and everything reopened retires the row it replaced. Sessions keep their name, note and
task across a reopen, and across a reboot: tmux is authoritative about what is running, the registry
about what it means.

Needs **tmux** (Linux, macOS); Windows support arrives with the PTY backend. Full command reference,
the cockpit, harness support table and where state lives: see
[docs/session-manager.md](session-manager.md).

---

## `ci-push`

One-shot push of a **GitHub Actions** run's computed metrics to a central, attributed to
the repository it ran in. Meant to be the **last step** of a workflow that already runs Claude
Code (it does **not** run Claude) — the ephemeral runner populates `~/.claude`, then `ci-push`
sends that run's session/token/cost aggregates before the runner is torn down. It reads
everything from the environment and takes no flags.

| Env var | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `AGENTISTICS_CENTRAL_URL` | yes | Central base URL, e.g. `https://central.example.com` |
| `AGENTISTICS_CI_TOKEN` | no | Repo-bound static token (fallback when OIDC is unavailable) |

Auth is **keyless GitHub OIDC** by default: with `permissions: id-token: write` on the job,
`ci-push` fetches a short-lived GitHub-signed token itself (audience = `AGENTISTICS_CENTRAL_URL`)
and the central verifies it against GitHub's JWKS. No secret needed. If no OIDC token can be
fetched it falls back to `AGENTISTICS_CI_TOKEN`. The repo must first be **registered** on the
central (Settings → Team → Repositories, which allowlists the remote and, for the fallback,
mints the token).

```bash
# inside a GitHub Actions job, after the Claude Code Action step:
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/blpsoares/agentistics/releases/latest/download/agentop" -o agentop
chmod +x agentop
./agentop ci-push
```

`ci-push` **never fails your job** — a push error (central down, unverifiable token) logs and
exits 0. It pushes **computed metrics only**, never chat. See
[`docs/github-actions.md`](./github-actions.md) for the full workflow + registration walkthrough.

---

## `autostart`

Register a mode to start with the system. On **Linux/WSL** this installs a systemd
**user** service at `~/.config/systemd/user/agentop-<mode>.service`, enables it
with `systemctl --user enable --now`, and runs `loginctl enable-linger` so it also
starts at boot without an active login. `enable` additionally installs a
`~/.bashrc` hook that runs [`agentop check-update`](#check-update) on every
terminal open. macOS and Windows print the manual step instead.

```bash
agentop autostart <mode> <enable|disable|status>
```

- `mode` ∈ `server` · `central` · `watch`
- `enable` — register + start the service (and add the terminal update hook)
- `disable` — stop and remove the service
- `status` — show enabled/active state; **omit the mode** to list all services

```bash
agentop autostart server enable    # start the dashboard at boot
agentop autostart status           # list every autostart service
agentop autostart watch disable    # stop the otel daemon service
```

---

## `upgrade`

Download and install the latest `agentop` release in place. (`update` is an alias.)

```bash
agentop upgrade
```

On a **central** you upgrade the Docker stack instead — pull the repo and rebuild:

```bash
git pull && bun run up:central    # or: agentop central pull
```

On a **member** running as a systemd service, restart it after upgrading:

```bash
agentop upgrade && systemctl --user restart agentop-server
```

---

## `check-update`

Prints the "new version available" banner **only** when a newer release exists,
and stays completely silent otherwise — so it's safe to run on every shell start.
This is exactly what the `~/.bashrc` hook installed by `agentop autostart …
enable` runs.

```bash
agentop check-update
```

---

## Update detection

agentistics surfaces available updates in three places, all sourced from the same
version check:

- **On command run** — most `agentop` commands print the update banner in parallel
  with startup (non-blocking); `--version` appends the notice too.
- **On terminal / boot** — the `~/.bashrc` hook added by `autostart … enable` runs
  `agentop check-update` when you open a shell (silent when you're current).
- **On the dashboard** — a bell notification plus a **mode-aware** upgrade modal
  showing the exact command for your role (a central shows `bun run up:central`; a
  member shows `agentop upgrade` then `systemctl --user restart agentop-server`). A
  periodic (~6h) server re-check pushes the notification live over SSE.


---

## `doctor`

Runs the exposure preflight: nine checks that decide whether this instance is safe to publish.
Exits non-zero on any failure, so going live can be gated on one command instead of on
remembering nine environment variables.

```bash
agentop doctor              # check against the current profile
agentop doctor --exposed    # check against the strict public bar

./central.sh doctor --exposed        # from a repo checkout, INSIDE the container
agentop central doctor --exposed     # same, from the standalone binary
```

**On a Docker central, prefer the `central.sh` / `agentop central` form.** The command
evaluates the configuration the deployment will actually run with — it reads `central.env` when
present and prints which file it used — but the owner-MFA and machine-token checks also need
MongoDB, which is reachable only from inside the compose network. Run on the host, those two
report as unverified, which counts as a failure by design.

`--exposed` evaluates as if `AGENTISTICS_EXPOSURE=public` were already set, which is how you
verify readiness **before** flipping it.

What it checks:

| Check | Fails when |
|---|---|
| `local-shell` | `/api/exec`, `/api/chat-tty`, the host transcript readers or `/api/mcp-action` are still reachable |
| `session-secret` | The secret is missing, shorter than 32 chars, or equal to the dashboard password |
| `tls` | `AGENTISTICS_TEAM_TLS` is unset on a public profile |
| `bind-ip` | `BIND_IP` is not loopback on a public profile — the tunnel connects locally, so anything wider is a way in that bypasses it |
| `trust-proxy` | *(warn)* forwarded-IP trust does not match the deployment, so per-IP limits apply to everyone at once |
| `owner-mfa` | Any owner account has no TOTP enrolled |
| `cors` | A plaintext origin sits in `AGENTISTICS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` |
| `mongo-auth` | *(warn)* the database has no credentials — acceptable only while its port stays unpublished |
| `machine-tokens` | *(warn)* no machine tokens have been minted yet |

A check that could not be verified — the database was unreachable, say — reports a **failure**,
not a reassuring pass. See [exposure.md](exposure.md) for the full deployment runbook.

---

## `setup-token`

Reissues a central's **one-time owner setup token** — the token first boot prints, and which the
dashboard asks for when it creates the first owner account.

```bash
agentop central setup-token      # from anywhere
./central.sh setup-token         # from a checkout
```

Use it when the boot that printed the token has scrolled away or its log rotated. It is **refused
once an owner exists**: past that point the way back in is [`reset-password`](#reset-password), not
a fresh setup token.

Run it **where the central runs** — inside the container/host serving it, not on a member.

---

## `reset-password`

Resets an account's password from the host. This is the **only way back in for a locked-out last
owner**, so it deliberately requires shell access to the machine running the central.

```bash
agentop central reset-password                              # list the accounts
agentop central reset-password --email ana@example.com      # prompts for the new password
agentop central reset-password --email ana@example.com --password '<new>' --clear-mfa
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--email <address>` | Which account. Omit to list them |
| `--password <new>` | Set it non-interactively (subject to the password policy) |
| `--clear-mfa` | Also drop the enrolled second factor — for a lost authenticator |

Every reset is written to the audit log. `--clear-mfa` removes a security control, so on a public
profile treat it as a break-glass action and re-enrol immediately: `owner-mfa` is one of the checks
[`doctor --exposed`](#doctor) fails on.
