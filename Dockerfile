# The unprivileged user, created FIRST so this layer caches forever.
#
# It used to be the LAST instruction, and it did `chown -R … /data /app`. Both halves were
# expensive in a way that does not show up until you measure it: the layer sat after
# `COPY --from=builder`, so every source change re-ran it, and `chown -R` over /app walks
# node_modules — ~90 seconds of build time. Worse, a layer records whole files, not metadata
# diffs: rewriting the ownership of every file made this single layer a 370MB duplicate of the
# image below it (1.11GB total for a ~700MB image).
#
# Ownership is now set where it belongs — as the files are copied (`COPY --chown`), which costs
# nothing — and /app itself stays root-owned. The app reads its own code and writes only /data,
# so not owning its code is the property we want anyway.

# The TLS trust store, installed EXPLICITLY rather than inherited from the base image.
#
# A central talks to Mongo over TLS (Atlas is `mongodb+srv://…`, certificate-verified). The base
# image happened to ship a usable trust store, so this worked — until a rebuild pulled a newer
# `oven/bun:1-slim` whose store differed, and every Mongo connection began failing with
# "Cert does not contain a DNS name". Same code, same Dockerfile, same commit: only the
# unpinned base had moved. The app served its static assets fine and 500'd on every route that
# touched the database, which reads as data loss rather than as a TLS fault.
#
# Depending on a base image for the trust store is depending on something nobody pinned. Install
# it here so a rebuild cannot silently take it away.
