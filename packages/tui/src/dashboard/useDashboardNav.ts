/**
 * useDashboardNav — the dashboard's own keyboard, wherever it is drawn.
 *
 * Which screen is open and which harness is selected are the same two questions full-screen and
 * inside the control center's tab, answered by the same keys, so they are answered ONCE here rather
 * than in both entry points. The rules themselves are pure (`resolveDashboardScreen`); this holds
 * the state and the `useInput` subscription.
 *
 * `capture` is the contract with whatever is hosting it: while the harness picker is open the
 * dashboard owns the keyboard, and the control center's global keys must stand down — `q` would
 * otherwise quit the whole app out from under a list the user is choosing from. The standalone app
 * uses the same flag to hold its own `?`/`q` handler back.
