 * the screens have to agree about lives here, against plain values, so no screen holds a rule of
 * its own: a second implementation of one screen is the bug `task-reopen.ts` exists to have fixed
 * once, and six screens is six chances to make it.
 *
 * The height arithmetic is why that matters. Full-screen, the old app had the whole terminal and its
 * screens simply drew what they had; inside a pane there is the terminal MINUS the chrome, the frame
 * and the screen strip, and Ink does not clip an overflowing child — it composites it, so a screen
 * one row too tall reads as a corrupted frame rather than as a cramped one. Every screen therefore
 * gets a budget it can actually spend, and each `*Plan` below states the order in which its parts
 * give way.
