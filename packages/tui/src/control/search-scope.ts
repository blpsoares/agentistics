 * session whose folder, harness, note and opening prompt were all invisible to the reader, so the
 * only way to learn which of them carried the word was to open the session and look. Worse, the
 * blob is composed differently for the three kinds of row, so the same query searched a different
 * set of things depending on whether a conversation happened to be running.
 *
 * Named fields make the scope a FACT the screen can print, which is what lets the header say how
