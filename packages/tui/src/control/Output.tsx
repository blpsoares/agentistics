/**
 * Output.tsx — what a running task says, inside the frame it was started from.
 *
 * The third thing that can occupy the cockpit's detail region, beside the facts and a question — and
 * the one that replaced leaving the application. The commands worth watching (`docker compose up
 * --build`, `central.sh up`, `bun run bin`) used to take the terminal: the app stepped out of the
 * alternate screen, the child inherited the tty, and the user pressed Enter to come back, having
 * lost their place. Now their output arrives on the host's output channel, already sanitised
 * (`control/stream.ts`), and lands here.
 *
 * This component decides nothing. The lines arrive ready to draw, the window they are sliced to is
 * `windowOffset`'s answer, and the follow state belongs to the screen that owns the keyboard.
