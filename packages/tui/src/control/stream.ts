/**
 * stream.ts — PURE conversion of a command's raw output into lines a pane can hold.
 *
 * The control center now watches its long commands from INSIDE the alternate screen: `docker
 * compose up --build`, `central.sh up`, `bun run bin`. Their output no longer goes to the terminal,
 * it goes into a framed pane Ink is composing — which means every byte has to be turned into
 * something with a known width and no way to move the cursor. That is what this module is for, and
 * it is deliberately pure: bytes in, lines out, no process, no Ink, no state that outlives a call.
 *
 * THE FOUR THINGS THAT GO WRONG, each of which this module exists to prevent:
 *
 *  1. PROGRESS REDRAWS. Build tools rewrite one row over and over with a carriage return:
 *     `#5 building 1.2s\r#5 building 2.4s\r#5 DONE\n`. Split on `\n` alone and that is ONE line
 *     three states long; split on `\r` as a terminator and it is three lines of noise. It is one
 *     line whose final state is `#5 DONE` — a `\r` means "the next thing overwrites what I just
 *     said", so a run of them collapses to its last fragment.
 *  2. ESCAPE SEQUENCES. A raw `\x1b[2A` inside a pane moves the REAL cursor, and everything Ink
 *     draws after it lands somewhere else — a frame that reads as corrupted rather than as a
 *     coloured line. Colour is stripped for the same reason it is not passed through: this app
 *     owns its palette, and a cell of escape bytes is a cell nobody paid for.
 *  3. CHUNK BOUNDARIES. A pipe splits wherever it likes — mid-line, mid-escape, mid-UTF-8 — so the
 *     remainder is carried in the state and completed by the next chunk. `createLineDecoder` adds
 *     a streaming `TextDecoder` on top for the byte half of the same problem.
 *  4. UNBOUNDED GROWTH. A long build prints thousands of lines and a pane shows a few dozen, so
 *     `appendLines` keeps the newest `OUTPUT_MAX_LINES` and drops the rest: a ring, not a log.
 */

/**
 * How many lines of a task's output are kept.
 *
 * A few hundred is several screens of scrollback at any terminal size and a fixed ceiling on
 * memory: a `docker compose build` of a cold cache prints thousands of lines, and none of the ones
 * that scrolled past twenty screens ago will be read. The pane is a view of what is happening now;
 * a service's real history is the Logs screen.

 * Everything a terminal would act on rather than show.
 *
 * In order: CSI sequences (colour, cursor movement, erase — parameters, then intermediates, then
 * the final byte), OSC strings (window titles, hyperlinks) with either terminator, and the
 * two-character escapes (`ESC M`, `ESC 7`). A DANGLING sequence at the very end of a line is
 * matched too: a chunk can split inside one, and the piece left over is bytes, not text.
