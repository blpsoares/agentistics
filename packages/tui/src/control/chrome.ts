 * as corrupted rather than as cramped — so a region that asks for one row too many is not a
 * cosmetic bug; and a region nobody asked for is the complaint that produced this shape.
 *
 * THE SHAPE — a band over a full-width detail pane:
 *
 *     ╭─ services ─────────╮╭─ config ─────────────╮   the BAND: two columns, equal height,
 *     ╰────────────────────╯╰──────────────────────╯   both content-sized
 *     ╭─ agentistics ───────────────────────────────╮  everything under it, full width
 *     │                                             │
 *     ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────╯
 *
 * The log pane used to be the thing under the band, and taking it away (logs belong to the Logs
 * screen) would have reopened the dead region it was introduced to fill — so the DETAIL pane moved
 * down into it. That is the right pane for the job on three counts: it is the one the enrichment is
 * for (runtimes and why one is unavailable, pid and uptime, the addresses, boot, history, the
 * endpoint), it is the one carrying the verbs, and at the full width its URLs and its reasons stop
 * being truncated by a column that was never wide enough for them.
 *
 * The band is exactly as tall as the TALLER of its two panes wants and no taller, so the surplus
 * belongs to the detail pane rather than sitting under a column as air. What remains is slack
 * INSIDE the detail pane, between its facts and the action row pinned to its floor — air inside a
 * pane is a pane, air under one is a fault.
 *
 * MINIMUM USEFUL HEIGHTS, and the order things give way:
 *
 *  1. Everything drawn: the band, then the detail pane with the rest.
 *  2. The DETAIL pane is served FIRST when the body is short — it holds the verbs, and a cockpit
 *     that can describe a service but not act on it is not a degraded cockpit. So the band is
 *     capped at `height - PANE_MIN_ROWS` (or `height - QUESTION_ROWS` while a question is open) and
 *     the config pane scrolls inside whatever that leaves.
 *  3. Below two frames' worth of body the detail pane goes, whole, and the band takes the rows
 *     back: a two-row box under everything says less than the rows it costs.
 *  4. The SERVICES pane is never dropped. It is the selection that drives the other two, and a
 *     cockpit with nothing selected is not a degraded cockpit but a blank screen; it scrolls its
 *     own rows instead.
 *  5. Width pressure is separate. Below `COCKPIT_MIN_WIDTH` — the two band columns' measured floors
 *     added together, not a round number — neither can say anything, so the layout STACKS:
 *     full-width panes in priority order services, detail, config. That is a deliberate collapse
 *     rather than letting Ink compress two columns into an unreadable pair.
 *  6. Below `PANE_MIN_ROWS` of body there is no room for a frame at all; the services pane comes
 *     back frameless (see `Pane`), which is the last honest thing this screen can be.

 * the whole of what the row has to say. It is not, and the consequence was the failure this screen
 * exists to prevent: below about a hundred columns the row read `agentistics  native+docker ▲`,
 * where the only thing marking two copies fighting over one port was a red triangle. The word is
 * what the row cannot be reduced to a colour without — and unlike the runtimes it is repeated
 * nowhere else, while the names are said twice more beside it, by the detail pane's badge and by
 * the conflict sentence that leads its facts.
 *
