/**
 * What the cockpit draws in the second BEFORE `refresh()` answers.
 *
 * `refresh()` shells out to systemd and to docker, so it takes about a second on a real machine —
 * and every detach REMOUNTS this app, because attach and detach are two halves of one gesture and
 * the loop lives in `runStart`. Anything the screen cannot know during that second falls back to a
 * default, and for the sessions list that means the arrangement someone chose is replaced by the
 * shipped one and then swapped back in front of them: not an incomplete frame but a WRONG one,
 * about a choice the user made.
 *
 * The assertion is on the FIRST frame on purpose. It is the frame that was wrong, and it is the one
 * that needs nothing to have resolved — which also keeps this test standing in a full `bun test`
 * run, where `useData.scope.test.ts` has replaced React's hooks process-wide by the time this file
 * is reached.

/**
 * Strip ANSI so assertions read against the visible text.
 *
 * The ESC byte is part of the pattern, and that is the whole point. This used to strip `[36m`
 * while LEAVING the `\x1b` in front of it, which was invisible for as long as no assertion
 * straddled a colour change: `GROUP repository` was drawn in one style, so the two words sat next
 * to each other and `toContain` matched. The moment the dimension VALUE got its own colour, a bare
 * `\x1b` landed between them and every one of these assertions failed against a frame that was
 * perfectly correct. A half-stripped frame is worse than an unstripped one — it reads as text right
 * up until it doesn't.
 *
 * Matches whole CSI sequences rather than only SGR (`…m`), so a cursor move or an erase cannot
 * reintroduce the same class of bug.
