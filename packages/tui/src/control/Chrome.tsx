/**
 * The title: the two-line block wordmark, with the machine's identity right-aligned on its LAST
 * line — or, on a terminal too narrow for both, the one-line mark with the same tag beside it.
 *
 * The shared baseline is the whole point of the arrangement. The original banner put three ragged
 * right-aligned lines beside two lines of art that started at a different row and ended at another,
 * so the two halves read as things that had been placed near each other rather than as one header.
 * Sitting the tag on the art's second row gives them one line to agree on.
 *
 * Which branch is drawn is decided by `headerLayout`, in the pure module, from the MEASURED art and
 * the measured tag — this component chooses nothing. The mode SENTENCE is not here either, only the
 * short token (`solo` / `central` / `member`): in member mode this row once read "member — sends
 * metrics to a central · http://198.51.100.199:48080" and wrapped, which shears every row below it.
 *
 * In the compact branch the MARK's columns are reserved before the tag is fitted, and `brandMark`
 * takes what that left. Both are total and neither can exceed what it was given, so the row cannot
 * wrap. Without the reservation the tag was fitted against the whole row and the mark got the
 * remainder, which in Portuguese member mode at twenty-eight columns was zero — a title row naming
 * the version and not the application.
