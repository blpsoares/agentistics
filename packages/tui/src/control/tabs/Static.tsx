/**
 * Static.tsx — the renderer shared by the Help, Cheat sheet and Contribute screens.
 *
 * All three are the same thing typographically: sections of `command → description` rows. One
 * component means the three cannot drift apart in alignment, scrolling or key handling, and a
 * change to the rhythm lands in all of them at once.
 *
 * They are LINEAR — prose and lists, not related live panes — so they are not cockpits and should
 * not pretend to be. What they share with the cockpit is the vocabulary: the shell frames each one
 * in the same `Pane`, the section headers are the same titled rule a pane's top border draws, and
 * prose is dim while the things you can type are not.
 *
 * The scroll cursor lives in the shell, not here. A component that owned it would lose its place
 * every time the screen was re-mounted, and the footer key hints would have to be duplicated.
