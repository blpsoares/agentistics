/**
 * Logs.tsx — a tailing viewer over this machine's service logs.
 *
 * This screen knows nothing about files, journals or docker: every line comes from
 * `host.readLog(source, max)`. That is deliberate — the log for the central is a `docker logs` call
 * and the one for a native server is a file, and letting the presentation layer learn that
 * difference is exactly how the TUI would grow a dependency on the host's filesystem.
 *
 * Nor does it know what the sources ARE. They come from `ControlStatus.services` through the pure
 * `logSources`, which is the fix for the one thing this file got persistently wrong: it used to
 * hold `['local', 'central', 'machine'] as const` and print those internal ids as labels, so the
 * selector offered `local` and `machine` — the native process and the container of the SAME logical
 * service — as two independent things, long after the model had made them one row everywhere else.
 *
 * It is the full-screen counterpart of the cockpit's detail pane: a viewport several times the size
 * of anything a pane could hold, a selector so it is not tied to whatever the cockpit has selected,
 * and every scroll key a document should answer. What it shares with the cockpit is the vocabulary
 * — the shell's `Pane` around it, an underlined active cell like the detail pane's action row, and
 * `● following` / `○ paused` said with a glyph as well as a color.
