/**
 * Services — the cockpit, and the default screen of the control center.
 *
 * The shape is lazygit's, for lazygit's reason: the data on this screen RELATES. The services list
 * is the selection and the detail pane is a view OF it, so moving the cursor repaints the pane —
 * every runtime the service could run under and the state of each, why one of them cannot be run
 * here at all, the pid and uptime of the one that is, the addresses it serves, and the machine
 * settings that bear on it.
 *
 * There is no log pane. Logs belong to the Logs screen: a tailing viewer squeezed into six rows was
 * a worse copy of a full screen one keypress away, and it was what pushed the pane this cockpit is
 * actually for into a column too narrow to state a URL. Taking it out is what let the detail pane
 * move under the band at the full width — see `cockpitLayout`.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because they are behaviour changes rather than cosmetics:
 *
 *  - Actions are FOCUS-SCOPED. With a service selected the verbs act on that service, which is why
 *    the old "Stop which? / Restart which?" submenus are gone — you are already standing on the
 *    target. Their `Everything` option survives as an explicit `Stop all` / `Restart all`, offered
 *    only when more than one service is running, because that is the one case where the submenu
 *    said something the selection cannot.
 *  - The list is one row per LOGICAL service, and what a row can DO follows from its state rather
 *    than from a branch here: a running service's verbs are restart / stop / open and there is no
 *    start among them, because the host offers `startOptions` only while nothing is up. That is the
 *    whole answer to "it offered to start a docker copy while one was already running" — the offer
 *    is unreachable, not refused after the fact. A stopped service keeps its row, dimmed, and its
 *    action row becomes exactly the starts this box can perform.
 *  - With the config pane focused the verbs are the config ones: connect / disconnect, change how
 *    history is preserved, switch language.
 *
 * Everything else is preserved to the letter — the archive gate before a foreground and a
 * background start (skipped for docker, never re-asked), the port-collision question, the
 * confirmed disconnect, the boot offer after a background start and after a central came up, and
 * the foreground handover through `onExit({ kind: 'foreground' })`. Nothing here decides what an
 * action DOES: every choice becomes one `host` call.
