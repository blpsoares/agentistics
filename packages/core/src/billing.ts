/**
 * billing.ts — how the user is ACTUALLY billed, and the arithmetic that re-expresses cost in those
 * terms.
 *
 * Every cost elsewhere in this product is an API-EQUIVALENT estimate: tokens × `MODEL_PRICING`.
 * Most people are not billed that way — they pay a flat monthly subscription, and the estimate is
 * an answer to a question they never asked. This module supplies the missing input (a timeline of
 * what they actually pay) and the arithmetic that turns the estimate into two facts they can use:
 *
 *   C = what the plan cost over the window        V = A / C, the value multiple
 *   A = the API-equivalent cost over that window  effective $/1M = C / (tokens / 1e6)
 *
 * ── THE MODEL IS A TIMELINE, NOT A SETTING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single "current plan" cannot price a window that spans a plan change, and there is NO per-
 * session record of which plan was in force — not in the transcripts, not in `~/.claude.json`,
 * nowhere. The user is the only source, so they declare PERIODS and each period prices its own
 * overlap with the window. Pro for three months then Max for two comes out right; anything
 * simpler comes out wrong and looks right.
 *
 * ── PRORATION IS BY DAYS, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `C = monthly × days / 30.44`. Counting whole calendar months is the INVOICE reading and it is
 * the more literal one — you did pay $100 even if you used three days — but it cannot survive an
 * arbitrary filter window: a 7-day filter would report a whole month's price against a fifth of a
 * month's usage and call the plan a bad deal. Proration is the RATE reading, and a rate is what
 * makes a window comparable to any other window. The invoice reading belongs on a surface that is
 * genuinely about one billing cycle, not here.
 *
 * ── UNCOVERED DAYS ARE CUT FROM BOTH SIDES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A day no period covers has an A and no C. Including it inflates V; excluding it from C alone
 * inflates V harder. So it is removed from BOTH, and `coveredDayKeys` is the SINGLE source of
 * which days count — no caller may re-derive it, or A and C end up measuring different periods
 * and the ratio between them means nothing. The facts that makes that honest (how many days, how
 * many sessions, how much API value) travel in `PlanCoverage` so the UI can state them without
 * recomputing anything.
 *
 * ── WHAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing here may return a confident number it cannot stand behind. A window with no covered day
 * is `unavailable`, not `0`; a multiple over a zero cost is `null`, not `Infinity`; a timeline
 * with overlapping periods is `unavailable` rather than the doubled C that the overlap would
 * produce. Overlaps are refused on entry AND re-checked here, because `preferences.json` is a
 * hand-editable file and a silently doubled bill is worse than no bill.
