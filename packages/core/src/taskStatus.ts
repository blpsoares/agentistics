/**
 * taskStatus.ts — the board's status VOCABULARY: an editable list, not a closed enum. Pure.
 *
 * The board shipped with a fixed seven-value union (`backlog | todo | in_progress | blocked |
 * in_review | done | abandoned`, `task-model.ts`'s old `TaskStatus`). A product owner asked for the
 * list itself to be editable — new statuses, renamed labels, chosen colours, deletion of the ones
 * nobody uses — while FOUR specific words keep meaning what several pieces of business logic already
 * compare against by exact string: `done_needs_session` and `blocked_needs_reason`
 * (`task-web.ts`'s `markTask`/`patchSubtask`) and the status-auto-advance rules
 * (`statusAfterAttach` / `statusAfterSubtaskProgress`, `task-model.ts`). Those four ids —
 * `PROTECTED_STATUS_IDS` — can never be renamed or deleted, on any board, ever; only their LABEL and
 * COLOR may be edited. Everything else — the three legacy words this board also shipped
 * (`backlog`, `in_review`, `abandoned`) and anything a person types in afterward — is an ordinary
 * entry: editable freely, deletable the moment nothing on the board still points at it.
 *
 * `Task.status`/`Subtask.status` themselves stay a plain `string` (see `task-model.ts`) — this
 * module is the one place that decides which strings are REAL statuses right now, and the one place
 * that decides what happens to the list when a board that predates it is opened for the first time.
