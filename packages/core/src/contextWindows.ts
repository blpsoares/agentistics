/**
 * contextWindows.ts — PURE. How large a model's context window is, and where that number came from.
 *
 * This is the second half of the context gauge, and it is the half that can lie. The measurement
 * ("212.959 tokens were sent on the last turn") is read off the transcript and is a fact. The
 * PERCENTAGE is that fact divided by a window, and the same 212.959 is 106% of a 200k window and
 * 21% of a 1M one — the same session, the same measurement, two confident and incompatible answers.
 * So the window is never guessed: it is looked up here or the bar is not drawn at all.
 *
 * The rule is `MODEL_PRICING`'s, applied to a different number. `CatalogPrice` requires
 * `verifiedAt` + `source` so a price cannot exist without provenance; `ContextWindow` requires the
 * same, so a window cannot either. A model nobody has verified is ABSENT from this table, and an
 * absent model draws no bar — which is visible, where a wrong percentage is not.
 *
 * Two things deliberately NOT here:
 *
 *  - **OpenAI and Google models.** Neither vendor publishes the input token limit on a page this
 *    could cite (checked 2026-08-14: Gemini's model list names every model and states no limit).
 *    Codex does not need them — it REPORTS its own window per session (`model_context_window`), and
 *    a harness stating the window for the session it is running outranks any table. Copilot and
 *    Gemini produce no context measurement at all, so there is nothing to divide. That leaves
 *    Antigravity's Gemini conversations and Kimi's routed models with a measurement and no window;
 *    they draw no bar until the figures can be cited.
 *  - **A guess for the harness's own cap.** Claude Code can run `claude-opus-5` under a 200k
 *    session cap (its `opus[1m]` model picker), and the transcript records only `claude-opus-5` —
 *    no suffix, no window field, checked across a whole transcript. This table therefore reports
 *    the MODEL's documented maximum, which is what the id can actually be resolved to. A session
 *    deliberately running the smaller cap reads low; that is a stated limitation of the reading,
 *    not a number invented to cover the gap.
