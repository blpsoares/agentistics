/**
 * redact.ts — strip credentials out of free text before it leaves the machine.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `SessionMeta.first_prompt` (and `title`) are the only free text a member
 * pushes to a central. The privacy contract says members push "computed metrics, never chat" —
 * and that is true of the transcript, but a first prompt IS chat. Pasting
 * `MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://user:pass@host` as the opening message of a session is enough for a
 * production credential to land, in plaintext, in the central's database, where it is then
 * replicated, backed up, and rendered in a dashboard. That is not hypothetical: it is how this
 * module came to be written.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINT — precision matters more than reach. `first_prompt` is what labels a session
 * in every list in the product. A redactor that also eats `input_tokens=123` or "the token count
 * was 1500" turns every label into noise, and the first thing anyone does with a noisy redactor
 * is disable it. So every generic rule below is guarded by a value-shape test: a secret is long,
 * mixed-character, and not a plain number or an obvious placeholder. When in doubt, this module
 * leaves the text ALONE — it is a safety net for the accidental paste, never a guarantee.
 *
 * It cannot promise to catch everything, and nothing here replaces rotating a leaked credential.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, so it runs identically on the member (before the push) and on the
 * central (on ingest, which is what protects against members still running older code).
