/**
 * comparison.ts — saved comparisons: N filter scopes measured against each other.
 *
 * A comparison is a QUESTION the user asked once and will ask again — "is Codex cheaper than
 * Claude for me", "did last month cost more than the one before". Keeping it means not rebuilding
 * two filter sets every time, and pinning it to the Home page means the answer is simply there.
 *
 * ── THE FIRST SIDE IS THE BASELINE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * With two sides a delta is symmetric and the order barely matters. With three or more it does:
 * every other side is reported RELATIVE TO THE FIRST, so reordering changes what the numbers mean.
 * That is why sides are an ordered list and why the first one is labelled as the baseline in the
 * UI rather than left to be inferred.
 *
 * ── LOCAL ONLY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These live in `preferences.json` beside the billing timeline. They describe how one person
 * looks at their own data; nothing here travels to a central.
