/**
 * subtaskSort.ts — how a delivery's SUBTASKS are ordered when a person clicks a column title.
 *
 * `taskSort.ts` orders TASKS and reads a `SortableRow`. A subtask is not one: it has no rank, no
 * priority, and the numbers next to it (cost, tokens, sessions) are not on the record — they are
 * measured through the sessions filed under it and arrive beside it, keyed by its id. So the comparator
 * is its own, but it obeys the same three rules, for the same reasons:
 *
 *  - **`null` is not zero, and it sorts LAST in both directions.** A subtask nobody has filed a
 *    session under has no cost; it is not the cheapest one. Reversing the arrow moves the measured
 *    rows and leaves the unmeasurable ones at the bottom, where they read as "no answer".
 *  - **Every sort is TOTAL.** Ties fall back to the position the subtask had in the list it was
 *    given — which is creation order, the list's own order — so the result is the same on every
 *    render, and equal values never reshuffle each other.
 *  - **No sort at all is a state** (`null`), and it is the list exactly as it came. The default of a
 *    subtask list is "the order I made them in", and a header that could only ever pick a key would
 *    leave that unreachable once touched.
 *
 * It sorts the FLAT list and knows nothing about groups. That is deliberate and it is what keeps a
 * group whole: the renderer (`clusterSubtaskRows`, in the web package) walks the list once, places a
 * group's header where the list puts it and pulls every member to sit under it, in the order the list
 * gives the members. So a sorted flat list already means "loose rows and group blocks ordered among
 * themselves, members ordered inside their group" — the cluster is rebuilt from the sorted list, never
 * shattered by it. `subtaskGroups.test.ts` pins that composition.
