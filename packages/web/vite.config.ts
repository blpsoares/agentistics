/**
 * **mermaid's dependency graph OVERLAPS the app's own** — `d3-shape`, `d3-hierarchy` and friends
 * reach this bundle a second way, through `recharts` → `victory-vendor`, and wherever the two
 * resolve to the same installed version rolldown places the shared code in ONE chunk (measured:
 * `CartesianChart-*.js`, 52 of its 265 modules are `d3-*` files mermaid also imports). Monaco never
 * had this problem — nothing else in this bundle imports `monaco-editor` — so its own routing below
 * checks "does ANY module trace to it"; doing the same for mermaid would take `CartesianChart` (used
 * on Home, Costs, every chart on the dashboard) out of the precache for the sake of a diagram most
 * sessions never open. So a chunk is MERMAID'S only when it is made of NOTHING ELSE: every module in
 * it must resolve through mermaid's own package or one of the dependencies below — each read off
 * `mermaid`'s own `package.json` `dependencies` (plus `lodash-es`, which is `dagre-d3-es`'s and
 * `chevrotain`'s own transitive dependency and, per `bun.lock`, nobody else's). Measured against a
 * real build: 96 chunks are ALL mermaid, 14 more touch it but are genuinely shared and are correctly
 * left alone.

/**
 * `d3` is a META-PACKAGE: `d3@7.9.0`'s own `dependencies` are ~30 separate `d3-*` packages
 * (`d3-shape`, `d3-scale`, `d3-array`, `d3-hierarchy`, `d3-time-format`, …), most of them reached
 * through the bare `import 'd3'` mermaid's diagram renderers use — not only through the one
 * (`d3-sankey`) this list used to name. A flat substring per sub-package is exactly the
 * hand-maintained list this file's own header warns against, and it was already wrong: measured
 * against a real build, `pieDiagram-*`, `ganttDiagram-*`, `sankeyDiagram-*`, `diagram-3UASUU5V-*`,
 * `chunk-ZIGJFQKS-*` and `src-CKoDGS-*` are 100% mermaid (every module in each resolves through
 * mermaid's own dependency tree) and still fell through to the generic `assets/` bucket — their
 * modules are real `node_modules/d3-shape/`, `node_modules/d3-scale/`, … folders, and NONE of them
 * contain the literal substring `/d3/` the old marker tested for (the character after `d3` there is
 * `-`, never `/`). Matched as a FAMILY instead — any path whose package segment is `d3` or
 * `d3-<word>` (one or more hyphenated words: `d3-scale-chromatic`, `d3-time-format`) — which also
 * correctly sweeps in the recharts/victory-vendor side's OWN older `d3-shape@1.3.7`/`d3-path@1.0.9`
 * if a chunk is ever made of nothing else. That is the safe direction to be wrong in, the same one
 * `assetFileNames` below states explicitly: worst case a genuinely chart-only chunk skips the
 * aggressive precache and is fetched once over the ordinary HTTP cache instead of never — never a
 * correctness bug, unlike shipping mermaid's own diagram-type chunks to every visitor's precache.
