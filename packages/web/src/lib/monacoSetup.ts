/**
 * monacoSetup.ts — self-hosted Monaco, no CDN, loaded only when the Repository tab is opened.
 *
 * TWO GUARANTEES, and both are structural rather than a matter of care:
 *
 * 1. **No CDN.** Every worker below is a Vite `?worker` import, so it is bundled out of
 *    `node_modules` and served from this origin like every other asset.
 * 2. **Lazy.** Monaco is reached ONLY through the dynamic `import('./monacoEntry')` in
 *    `loadMonaco()`, so it lands in its own chunk and a user who never opens the Repository tab
 *    never downloads it. **This module must itself only ever be imported dynamically**: Vite hoists
 *    the `?worker` wrappers below into the Monaco chunk, so a STATIC `import { loadMonaco }` would
 *    drag ~4.4 MB into whatever chunk wrote it.
 *
 * **The editor is composed in `monacoEntry.ts`, not imported from the `monaco-editor` barrel.** Read
 * that file's header for why: the barrel's TypeScript LANGUAGE SERVICE emits a 6.9 MB
 * `ts.worker.js` at build time whether a browser ever asks for it or not, and this feature has the
 * service switched off by design. Everything the barrel registers except that one language service
 * is registered there, grammars included — `.ts` and `.js` keep their syntax highlighting.
 *
 * **The import specifiers there are `monaco-editor/<path-under-esm/vs>`, NOT
 * `monaco-editor/esm/vs/...`.** monaco-editor 0.56 ships an `exports` map whose subpath pattern is
 * `"./*": "./esm/vs/*.js"`, so the `esm/vs/` prefix every pre-0.5x recipe still uses now resolves
 * to `esm/vs/esm/vs/...` and fails outright. Verified against the installed package.
 *
 * **WHY THIS FILE STILL HAS TO EXIST ON 0.56, and why it must answer EVERY label.** Measured
 * against a real production build, not assumed:
 *
 * - The LANGUAGE workers (json, css, html) carry their own
 *   `createWorker: () => new Worker(new URL('./x.worker.js', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })`
 *   inside monaco's own `workerManager.js`, which Vite recognises and self-hosts unaided. They are
 *   emitted into `dist/assets/` whether this file names them or not.
 * - The BASE editor worker does NOT. It offers only
 *   `esmModuleLocationBundler: () => new URL('…/editorWebWorkerMain.js', import.meta.url)` — a bare
 *   asset URL, and that 544-byte file is under Vite's inline limit, so the build turns it into a
 *   `data:text/javascript;base64,…` URL whose first line is a RELATIVE import. A relative import
 *   cannot resolve against a `data:` URL, so without the `EditorWorker` below the base worker is
 *   dead on arrival — this file's reason for existing, now demonstrated rather than believed.
 * - And `MonacoEnvironment.getWorker` is consulted BEFORE a descriptor's own `createWorker`. So
 *   defining it at all takes over for EVERY label, including the three that worked by themselves:
 *   a label `workerFor` declines is a language broken by this file, not one left alone. That is why
 *   all four are wired even though only one of them is strictly ours.

 * `typescript` (the language service this change removes on purpose) and `lsp` (unreachable through
 * the package's `exports` map). Both are therefore `undefined` at RUNTIME while the type says
 * otherwise: the single narrow lie in this file, stated here rather than discovered.
 *
 * Nothing in the app touches either member — there is no other reader, which is what makes the
 * trade safe today. **If you reach for `monaco.typescript`, it is not there**: re-register the
 * feature in `monacoEntry.ts` (and with it 6.9 MB) rather than trusting this type.
