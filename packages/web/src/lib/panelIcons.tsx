/**
 * panelIcons.tsx — the ONE place a `PanelId` becomes a picture.
 *
 * `panelMeta.ts` stays icon-free on purpose (pure, no React — see its own header), so this is the
 * `.tsx` counterpart every renderer resolves through: `PanelRail.tsx`'s icons, `bandControls.tsx`'s
 * `PanelBar` (the bottom band's own tab strip) and the mobile panel menu. One table, so a reader
 * never sees a different glyph for "Skills" depending on which of the three drew it.
 *
 * `cli` draws the session's own harness mark when one is known (the same convention the pre-rail
 * `PanelBar` already used) and a plain terminal glyph otherwise; `shell` always draws the terminal
 * glyph, since it is nobody's assistant.
