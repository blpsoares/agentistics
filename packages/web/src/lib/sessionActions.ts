/**
 * sessionActions.ts — PURE. Which single action a session row leads with, and which of its verbs
 * are watchable, decided from the fleet row alone.
 *
 * The eight verbs a session can take (`Answer its question`, `Send a prompt`, `Rename`, `Note`,
 * `Task`, `Open whole task`, `Finish task`, `Stop session`) live behind a menu — a row is not a
 * toolbar. What stays on the row is the ONE action that state is about, so a glance answers "what
 * would I do here". This module decides that one, and it decides it the same way the terminal
 * cockpit does: from the state, using the server's own already-localized verb labels, never
 * inventing a new rule the two surfaces could then disagree on.
 *
 * The one invariant this module carries in TYPES: **`Answer its question` is a HUMAN action.** A
 * `waiting-approval` session is blocked on a person, and nothing in this product may answer for
 * them — so `primaryAction` marks that one `human: true`, and the UI renders it as a person's
 * click, never a thing the page could do on its own.
