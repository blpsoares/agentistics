/**
 * terminalTarget.ts — PURE. WHICH terminal a surface is showing, and everything that follows from
 * the answer.
 *
 * There are two panes behind one session and they are not interchangeable: the CLI's own screen
 * (an assistant running under tmux, resolved against `managed-sessions.json`) and the utility SHELL
 * the person opened themselves (its own tmux socket, resolved against `shells.json`). Handing one
 * channel the other's id is precisely the mistake `terminalEndpoint.ts` splits the scopes to make
 * impossible — so the target decides the SCOPE and the ID together, here, rather than at each of
 * the three surfaces that draw a terminal.
 *
 * **Why this module exists at all.** The header used to carry a `Conversa | Terminal` toggle and the
 * dedicated screen a second `Assistente | Shell` one: two controls for one decision, in two places,
 * with different words. The toggle is gone — the conversation is what a session opens on, and the
 * BAND at the foot of the panel is the door to both terminals — so there is now exactly one
 * question ("which terminal") asked in exactly one vocabulary.
 *
 * **The CLI pane is named after its HARNESS.** "Assistente" named a concept the reader has to
 * translate; `Claude Code` names the thing that is on the screen. Reported as "invés de assistant
 * coloca algo que dê a entender mais fácil". Where the harness cannot be named the label falls back
 * to words rather than to a blank segment — the same rule every N/A in this product follows.
