/**
 * sessionArtifacts.ts — PURE: which files the open session has written, from the conversation it
 * is already showing.
 *
 * THIS NEEDS NO SERVER, and that is the design rather than an economy. `ChatTurn.tools` already
 * arrives on every turn as `{ name, detail }`, and `chat-tail.ts`'s `toolDetail` reads named
 * fields in priority order — so for a file tool the `detail` IS the `file_path`. `SessionChat`
 * already polls that payload, so this list is exactly as fresh as the conversation beside it and
 * the two can never disagree by a poll interval.
 *
 * SELECTION IS BY TOOL NAME, NEVER BY THE SHAPE OF `detail`. `toolDetail`'s first key is
 * `command`, so a `Bash` call's detail is a shell line — and "this looks like a path" would put
 * `rm -rf build/` in a list of files somebody is about to click.
 *
 * AND IT IS THE CANONICAL NAME, NOT THE DISPLAYED ONE. A turn carries both: `name` is what the
 * harness itself called the tool (agy's `write_to_file`), which is what the bubble shows because a
 * conversation records what happened; `canonical` is the same tool under the shared vocabulary
 * (`Write`), present only where the two differ. This set is written in the shared vocabulary, so it
 * reads `canonical ?? name` — matching on the displayed name alone would make this panel blind on
 * every harness but Claude, and rewriting the displayed name to suit this set is what put Claude's
 * tool names in an Antigravity session's bubbles.
 *
 * `Read` is excluded. The question this panel answers is what the session PRODUCED; an assistant
 * reading forty files to answer one question would bury the two it wrote.

/**
 * WHY THE COUNT OF WRITTEN FILES IS SHORT — the two sentences that qualify it, in order.
 *
 * The aside's header is the only surviving statement of how many files a session wrote (`N files ·
 * M new`), and it undercounts for two unrelated reasons. Both were reported as the panel having
 * missed something it wrote, and both had a surface on the file lists that are gone; this is the
 * ONE place that decides what is said and in which order, so the two facts cannot drift apart or
 * get a third wording somewhere else.
 *
 *  - **`unlisted`** — the session wrote through commands whose paths cannot be read AT ALL (an
 *    interpreter fed a heredoc), so those files are in no count. Composed here, in this panel's own
 *    words, because nothing server-side words it: `hasUnlistedWrites` above is the browser's own
 *    reading of turns it already has.
 *  - **`outside`** — files that ARE counted elsewhere but sit outside the session's own folder, so
 *    the read route refuses them. Passed through **VERBATIM**: the server already worded it
 *    (`fleet-web.ts`'s `listSessionArtifacts`), it holds a COUNT and never the paths, and composing
 *    a second sentence for something the server has already said is how two surfaces come to
 *    disagree about one fact.
 *
 * `unlisted` leads because it is the wider limit — a file it covers is not merely unopenable, it is
 * unnameable — and that is the order the retired list footer printed them in.
 *
 * An empty array is the ordinary case and must draw NOTHING: an absent sentence costs no line.
