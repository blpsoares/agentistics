/**
 * filtersToTag.ts — PURE mapping from the dashboard's active `Filters` to a tag draft
 * (`{ sources, filters, window }`) ready to hand to the "New tag" drawer.
 *
 * The two models do not line up for free. A dashboard filter is a flat AND across every active
 * dimension ("project X AND harness Y AND model Z"). A tag's OWN two fields are not that: `sources`
 * is an OR union with no per-type grouping at all (mixing types there computes "X OR Y OR Z", a much
 * BROADER population than the dashboard view), while `filters` narrows grouped by type — OR within
 * a type, AND across types — which is exactly the dashboard's AND semantics, but only once `sources`
 * has already named a population to narrow. An empty `sources` list is not "everything"; per the
 * tag system's own invariant it is nothing at all.
 *
 * So every active dimension is kept — nothing is dropped — but at most ONE of them becomes
 * `sources`; every other active dimension becomes a `filters` entry of its own type. Which one
 * leads is `PRIMARY_PRIORITY` below: identity-shaped dimensions (project, repo) first, since a tag
 * is naturally "about" a codebase; attribute dimensions (harness, model, user, machine, team) are
 * narrower framings of that population and read more naturally as a restriction.
