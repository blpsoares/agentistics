/**
 * panelBar.ts — the BOTTOM BAND's own tab strip: which of the panels currently PLACED AT THE BOTTOM
 * it offers, in what order, and which is lit.
 *
 * AFTER THE RIGHT ICON RAIL (2026-09-21), this bar's job narrowed. It used to be the ONE switcher for
 * all five panels regardless of which slot they occupied — a quick-jump control reachable from
 * wherever you were. The rail (`PanelRail.tsx`) is now that control for every RAIL-placed panel, so a
 * bar embedded in the bottom band that ALSO offered rail panels would be two competing switchers
 * disagreeing about which one is the "real" way to reach them. This bar is scoped to exactly what the
 * bottom band can ever show: the panels PLACED at the bottom (`panelSlots.ts`'s `bottomPanels`),
 * however many there are — the default two (`cli`/`shell`), or any others the gear/drag has moved
 * there since.
 *
 * Pure and React-free so the ORDER and the LIT tab can be tested without mounting anything.

 * to `'shell'`, on the reading that `ShellBand` always has its own `cli`/`shell` toggle to offer and
 * so is a floor rather than an empty region. That reading predates PLACEMENT: once every panel can
 * be moved to the rail, `cli` and `shell` included, the floor draws a bar with no tabs in it — a
 * thin strip holding one orange `−` and nothing else, reported twice ("o - ainda aparece na barra
 * mesmo com ela fechada"). An earlier fix guarded `SimpleDockedBand` and `PanelBarBand` and missed
 * this one, because the strip comes from the band that is SELECTED here rather than from a band
 * rendering its own emptiness.
 *
 * COLLAPSED IS NOT EMPTY, and the two must not be confused: panels placed at the bottom with the
 * band collapsed keep their band — its tabs and the chevron that reopens it — and that is
 * `bottomHasPanels`, NOT `bottomOccupant !== null`. The first draft of this fix read the occupant,
 * which is `null` for a collapsed band too, and took the whole band away with Claude Code and Shell
 * still parked in it: caught on a live preview before it shipped. Nothing placed at all is the
 * empty case, and it renders NOTHING.
 *
 * A PHONE KEEPS THE FLOOR. There is no rail there, and `ShellBand`'s own segment at the foot of the
 * chat is how a phone reaches the session's terminal at all; taking it away because a placement
 * decided on a desktop says `rail` would leave a phone with no route to it. A RELAYED session with
 * nothing docked keeps the narrow `'bar-only'` fallback on desktop, `'none'` on a phone.
