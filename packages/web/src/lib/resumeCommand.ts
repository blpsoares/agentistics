/** How each CLI resumes a session by id, verified against each tool's own `--help`:
 *   claude  → `claude --resume <uuid>`
 *   agy     → `agy --conversation <id>`      ("Resume a previous conversation by ID")
 *   codex   → `codex resume <SESSION_ID>`    (positional; UUIDs take precedence)
 *
 * Gemini is deliberately absent: its `--resume` takes "latest" or a list index, not a session id
 * (`--session-id` starts a NEW session with that id), so there is no command that reopens a
 * specific past session. Copilot is absent for the same reason — no verified syntax. Emitting a
 * plausible-looking command that does the wrong thing is worse than saying it is unavailable. */
