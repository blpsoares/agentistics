/**
 * sessionTranscript.ts — PURE. Where a session's messages are read from, per harness.
 *
 * The "Details" popover used to fetch `/api/sessions/<id>/messages`, a route that has never existed
 * on this server. It 404s, the `.then(r => r.ok ? r.json() : [])` turns that into an empty array,
 * and the panel says "no recent messages" — on a live session with sixty-five of them. A confident
 * "there is nothing" produced by a request that was never answered is exactly the failure mode
 * `liveEmptyNotice` and `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` exist to prevent, one layer up.
 *
 * The real readers were already there, one per harness, and they all return the same
 * `{ role, content, timestamp }` shape. This module is the mapping to them, as a
 * `Record<HarnessId, …>` so the build fails when a harness is added and nobody decides.
