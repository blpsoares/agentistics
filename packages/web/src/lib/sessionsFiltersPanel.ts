/**
 * sessionsFiltersPanel.ts — PURE: the keyboard decisions the Filtros panel's collapse makes, and
 * where the panel is allowed to sit on screen.
 *
 * The panel is always MOUNTED (the grid-rows animation needs the collapsed state still in the DOM
 * to glide out of it), so a `gridTemplateRows: 0fr` + `overflow: hidden` collapse is a purely VISUAL
 * fact — every control inside it (the date presets, "Limpar filtros", the dimension chips) stayed
 * reachable by Tab and readable by a screen reader while invisible. Reported by review: 12 Tab
 * presses from the closed trigger crossed nine hidden controls, including "Limpar filtros" — a
 * keyboard user pressing Enter there silently clears every filter and turns "Só ativas" off.
 *
 * `filtrosPanelInert` answers what the DOM should carry: the HTML `inert` attribute (not
 * `visibility: hidden`, which still leaves an element focusable via `tabindex` in older engines, and
 * not `aria-hidden` alone, which does not stop a *sighted* keyboard user tabbing into it) removes a
 * collapsed panel from the tab order and the accessibility tree in one step, the same technique
 * `RepoFileEditor.tsx` and `Studio.tsx` already use for a hidden layer in this codebase. `true` is
 * given rather than `false` so the collapsed case renders the attribute at all — an element is only
 * ever inert by that attribute's PRESENCE, and `inert={false}` still creates a false-vs-absent
 * distinction some engines have gotten wrong.
 *
 * `sessionsFiltersShouldReturnFocus` answers the other half: if the reader's focus is INSIDE the
 * panel at the moment it collapses (its own trigger, `inert`, or a stray close-on-blur elsewhere
 * moved it there), that focus needs to land back on the trigger — or it lands on `inert` content and
 * the browser resets it to the document body, which reads as "the keyboard silently stopped
 * working". It answers `false` while the panel is (or is about to be) open: only a COLLAPSE ever
 * needs to relocate focus, since expanding never removes anything from the tab order.
 *
 * `filtrosPanelBounds` answers the THIRD thing, added after review found the panel's fixed-440px
 * cap wrong: at 1024×768 with the artifacts aside at its own DEFAULT width, the aside renders at
 * 439px — not the 620px the fix's own reasoning assumed — so a fixed cap left the panel's right
 * edge 15px past the aside's left edge, painting over the "Studio" and "Live" tabs. A fixed width
 * cannot be right when BOTH neighbours are resizable, collapsible, and change shape across
 * breakpoints — the only durable anchor is the room that is ACTUALLY there, measured from the two
 * real elements (`App.tsx` reads the fleet aside's own live width; `SessionsPage.tsx` measures the
 * artifacts aside's box with a `ResizeObserver` and reports its left edge through
 * `rightAsideEdge.ts`, re-measuring on every drag, open/close and window resize). This function is
 * the pure arithmetic on top of those two measurements: never trust the requested width over the
 * room that is actually there.

 * measure). `rightAside` is the artifacts aside's box, or `null` when it is not on screen at all
 * (closed) — only its `left` edge is read, which is the one boundary the panel must never cross.
 * `viewportWidth` is the fallback right edge for a closed aside, and the ceiling on the room a wide
 * monitor could otherwise hand the panel unbounded.
 *
 * The available room is CLAMPED, never trusted at its preferred width — a room narrower than
 * `FILTROS_PANEL_PREFERRED_WIDTH` shrinks the panel to fit it, exactly the clearance the fixed
 * 440px cap assumed would always hold and, at 1024×768 with the aside at its default width, did
 * not. `FILTROS_PANEL_MIN_WIDTH` is the floor under that clamp: once the room itself is narrower
 * than a usable panel, there is no width left that avoids overlap, and the floor is the least of it
 * rather than a panel squeezed to nothing.
