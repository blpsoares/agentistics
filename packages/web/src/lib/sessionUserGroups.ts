/**
 * sessionUserGroups.ts — user-defined session groups ("Saved to later", …) — PURE + persisted.
 *
 * Distinct from `fleetGroups.ts`'s AUTOMATIC grouping (project/task/status), which recomputes on
 * every render from what a session IS. A user group is a NAMED, manually curated set of sessions
 * that stays exactly where the person put it — "eu crio um grupo 'Saved to later' … elas ficam
 * salvas nesse grupo e o grupo só some se eu deletar ele" — regardless of the session's own state.
 * It reflects a decision the person made, not a fact about the work the automatic groupings expose.
 *
 * IDENTITY: keyed by `sessionIdentityKey` (see `sessionIdentity.ts`) — the same key `pinnedSessions.ts`
 * uses, and for the same reason: a reopen mints a new managed id for the same conversation, and a
 * group a person built must survive that exactly as a pin does (with the same known gap for
 * `conversationBlind` harnesses — see that module's header).
 *
 * PERSISTENCE: the server, through `sharedPref.ts` — a group is a fact about the WORK ("I started
 * this, I'm not doing it now, I don't want to have to go find it again"), not about the screen it
 * was made on. Same shape and same reasoning as `pinnedSessions.ts`.
 *
 * A SESSION BELONGS TO AT MOST ONE USER GROUP. Dropping it into a second group MOVES it out of the
 * first — two "queues" both claiming one session would each read as authoritative, which is worse
 * than the product picking one.
 *
 * DUPLICATE NAMES ARE ALLOWED. Refusing them needs a global lock the person has no reason to expect
 * ("group name already exists" for a name they picked because it was obvious), and nothing else in
 * this feature depends on uniqueness — groups are addressed by id everywhere, never by name.
