/**
 * terminalShortcuts.ts — PURE. Which key combinations the terminal takes from the browser while it
 * holds the keyboard, and — far more important — which it may never touch.
 *
 * Reported: "quando eu estiver no terminal, quero que os atalhos funcionem (ctrl l ctrl w etc). sem
 * afetar o navegador." Both halves of that sentence are the specification. Today `ctrl+w` closes
 * the tab and `ctrl+l` focuses the address bar, so neither ever reaches the pane; and the naive fix
 * — swallow anything with ctrl — costs somebody their devtools, their new tab and, on a Mac, every
 * application shortcut there is.
 *
 * So the rule is narrow on purpose and stated once:
 *
 *  - **Take only what the channel can actually deliver.** `CTRL_SHORTCUTS` is exactly the set of
 *    letters `KEY_ALLOWLIST` carries as `C-<letter>`. Swallowing `ctrl+z` would cost the browser
 *    shortcut and deliver nothing in exchange, because the server would refuse it as `bad_key`.
 *  - **Never `ctrl+shift+*`.** Devtools, the incognito window, reopen-tab. The VS Code extension in
 *    this repo records the identical rule for its panel — swallow these and the editor around the
 *    terminal stops working.
 *  - **Never Cmd/Win, never Alt.** On a Mac every application shortcut is Cmd; a terminal that ate
 *    them is a terminal you cannot copy out of, quit, or switch away from.
 *
 * The caller applies this ONLY while the emulator is focused and the write channel is open. A
 * page-level handler that swallowed `ctrl+w` whenever a terminal existed somewhere on screen would
 * be a browser the person cannot close.
 */

/**
 * The letters this terminal claims when they arrive with ctrl alone.
 *
 * Exactly the ones `KEY_ALLOWLIST` (server, `input-protocol.ts`) accepts as `C-<letter>`:
 * `C-a` `C-c` `C-d` `C-e` `C-k` `C-l` `C-u` `C-w`. Mirrored here for the reason the key allowlist
 * itself is mirrored — so the client does not claim a keystroke the server will refuse.
