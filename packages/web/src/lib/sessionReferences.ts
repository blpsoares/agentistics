/**
 * sessionReferences.ts — PURE: the "References" section of the session metrics card.
 *
 * Everything on that card that is a LINK — somewhere to go from the figures — is gathered into one
 * list at its foot instead of being scattered through it (the delivery at the top, the way to the
 * full reading at the bottom). This module decides WHICH rows exist, in what order and with what
 * words; the component only draws what it returns, and never asks "is there a delivery" itself.
 *
 * **A ROW EXISTS ONLY WHEN IT CAN DO WHAT IT SAYS.** A link to a tab that is not there, or to a
 * delivery the session is not filed under, is the dead control this product refuses everywhere, so
 * an unavailable row is ABSENT rather than disabled, and a list with nothing in it is EMPTY — the
 * caller then draws no heading over nothing.
 *
 * **THE LIVE ROW STATES WHAT IS RUNNING, AND OPENS THAT.** `live` is the edge strip's own fact
 * (`currentAction`, the newest event whose turn has not finished), so a session running `bun test`
 * says so here and the press lands on that command's row; one delegating to a subagent says that
 * and lands on the delegation. With nothing in flight the row is still a link to the Live tab —
 * the feed of what the session did is worth opening when nothing is happening right now — but it
 * then names nothing, because "nothing is running" is a claim only the conversation can back and
 * this list may be looking at one that is not being read (the terminal view).
