/**
 * `monacoEntry.ts` IS A LIST, AND A LIST ROTS. This test is the thing that notices.
 *
 * The file composes Monaco from the package's published subpaths instead of its `monaco-editor`
 * barrel, for one measured reason: the barrel's TypeScript language service drags in a 6,914,791-byte
 * `ts.worker.js` that Vite emits at BUILD time whether a browser ever fetches it or not, and this
 * feature does not register that service at all. Dropping it took the embedded web bundle from
 * 19,259.0 KB to 12,406.6 KB — a third of the `agentop` binary's web payload.
 *
 * Paying for that with a hand-maintained list buys three failure modes, and NONE of them shows up in
 * a build, a type check or a browser:
 *
 *  1. **A grammar upstream adds is a language that silently loses its colour here.** The build stays
 *     green, every other language still highlights, and the only symptom is a `.kt` file rendering
 *     in plain grey — which looks like nothing at all until somebody opens one.
 *  2. **A CONTRIBUTION upstream adds, or one dropped here by a bad merge, is a MISSING EDITOR
 *     FEATURE.** This is the half whose loss is silent and the half this test was first written
 *     without: deleting `editor/contrib/find/browser/findController` left 6 tests passing and 0
 *     failing, and so did deleting `features/register.all` — which is EVERY contribution: find, the
 *     context menu, folding, suggest, bracket matching, rename. A green build and an editor with no
 *     find widget. The 9 hand-copied imports at the entry's tail are exactly where a Monaco upgrade
 *     drops one.
 *  3. **The 6.9 MB comes back in one import.** Re-adding `languages/features/typescript/register`
 *     (or a `?worker` for `ts.worker`) is a one-line change that nothing else in the repo objects
 *     to, and the cost lands in the installer rather than on a screen.
 *
 * So all three are asserted against the INSTALLED package and against the module's own source, in
 * the shape `tokens.lint.test.ts` and `billing-detect.test.ts` already use here. A monaco upgrade
 * that ships a new language or a new contribution now fails the build with its path in the message.
