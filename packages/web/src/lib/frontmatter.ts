 * frontmatter.ts — PURE: pulls a leading YAML frontmatter block off a markdown file.
 *
 * NOT A YAML PARSER. SKILL.md and most docs in this repository open with a flat block of
 * `key: value` lines (occasionally one nested one level, like `metadata:\n  type: x`), and pulling
 * in a real YAML library for that is the same trade this codebase already refused for syntax
 * highlighting (`codeHighlight.ts`'s own header) and for TOML (`monacoLanguage.ts`): a grammar
 * engine bought for a shape a dozen lines already cover. So this reads exactly two shapes —
 * `key: value` at column 0, and everything indented under it kept as that key's own text — and
 * refuses anything else outright rather than guessing at real YAML (flow lists `[a, b]`, anchors,
 * multi-document `---`/`...`). A refusal is `data: null`; the CALLER decides what that means (here,
 * `MarkdownPreview` shows the raw block as a code fence — see its own header).
