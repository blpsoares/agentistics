/**
 * panelSlots.ts — the pure model behind where the Studio, Claude Code's own pane and the Shell sit,
 * plus the per-browser store that carries it across the app.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS FIXES. The Studio used to be a MODE of `ArtifactsAside` (`studio` state, a `Layer`
 * over the aside's own chrome). Opening it therefore opened the session-contents panel too: the
 * header's contents button lit up beside the Studio button, and the Studio's own bar carried a way
 * back into a panel the reader never asked for. Two components, one open flag.
 *
 * THE MODEL. Four PANELS — `contents` (today's `ArtifactsAside`), `studio`, `cli` (the session's own
 * assistant pane) and `shell` (the per-session utility shell) — and two SLOTS — `right` (the aside
 * box: split / overlay / fullscreen) and `bottom` (the band docked under the composer). A panel sits
 * in AT MOST ONE slot at a time: opening panel P in slot S when P is already in the OTHER slot MOVES
 * it rather than duplicating it, and opening P where panel Q already sits DISPLACES Q — Q simply
 * stops being shown anywhere. `contents` never goes to the bottom: a tabbed list does not fit a band,
 * and nobody asked for it there.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE PURE CORE. `openPanel` / `closePanel` / `movePanel` / `allowed` / `resolveForViewport`
 * take a `SlotLayout` explicitly and return a new one — no store, no `localStorage`, no React. That is
 * what makes "every panel × slot × occupant" a table a test can walk exhaustively, and it is what a
 * re-parenting host (`StudioHost.tsx`) can reason about without touching a live subscription.
 *
 * THE STORE, layered on top, is the per-browser preference — like `boardPrefs.ts` / `shellBand.ts`'s
 * own `readBandPrefs`, never `/api/preferences` (shared by everyone signed in on a central). It is
 * guarded exactly like those: a private window, cleared site data or a browser blocking storage costs
 * the memory, never the feature. The panels' CONTENT stays per session — switching session keeps the
 * layout and mounts that session's own Studio / shell in the same slots; nothing here is keyed by
 * session because the layout is a fact about the BROWSER, not about which conversation is open.
 *
 * CLOSING (or DISPLACING) THE STUDIO ASKS FIRST when it holds unsaved buffers — the same question
 * `artifactsStore.closeArtifacts` already asks, through the same `unsavedBuffers.ts`. A MOVE never
 * asks: nothing is dropped by changing which slot shows a panel that stays mounted throughout.
