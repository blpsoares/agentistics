/**
 * panelSlots.ts — the pure model behind every panel in the sessions workspace: the icon RAIL on the
 * right, the tab strip docked at the BOTTOM, and the per-browser store that carries the layout
 * across the app.
 *
 * THE MODEL, AS OF THE RIGHT-ICON-RAIL PASS (2026-09-21, `sdd/scratch/right-rail-spec.md`).
 * `contents` stopped existing as a container: its ten former tabs (`live`, `gallery`, `skills`,
 * `agents`, `forks`, `workflows`, `mcps`, `prs`, `tasks`, `metrics`) are each their own `PanelId`
 * now, exactly like `studio`/`cli`/`shell`/`hardware` already were. FOURTEEN panels in total.
 *
 * Every panel carries a `Placement` — `'rail'` (an icon on the right rail), `'bottom'` (a tab in the
 * bottom band) or `'hidden'` (reachable from neither) — plus an `order` within that placement. This
 * is new: before this pass, "which slot a panel reaches" and "which panel currently occupies a slot"
 * were the SAME fact (a panel sat in AT MOST one of two slots, one occupant each). They are now two
 * different questions. PLACEMENT answers "where does this panel's icon/tab live" and is a per-browser
 * PREFERENCE, changed by the gear's move verbs (this pass), drag, or the hide/restore verbs (a later
 * pass). OCCUPANCY answers "which panel is the content area / the bottom band showing RIGHT NOW" —
 * `right`/`bottom` on `SlotLayout`, exactly as before — and only a panel whose placement allows it
 * (rail → the right content area, bottom → the bottom band) can ever be the occupant of that slot.
 *
 * WHY THIS SPLIT MATTERS: the rail can hold many icons at once (the default has twelve), so
 * "placement" cannot be an occupancy fact the way the old two-slot model had it — only ONE of those
 * twelve is ever actually showing in the content area at a time, which is what `right`/`bottom`
 * still track. A panel whose placement is `'hidden'` has no icon and no tab anywhere, so it cannot be
 * an occupant either — `openPanel` refuses it exactly as the old model refused a panel `allowed()`
 * said could not reach a slot.
 *
 * `restoreTo` remembers where a HIDDEN panel used to live (`'rail'` or `'bottom'`, never `'hidden'`
 * itself) so the eye's "put it back" verb (a later pass) has an answer — the direct descendant of the
 * old model's `lastSlot`, narrowed to the one case that still needs remembering: a panel that is
 * currently placed (rail or bottom) already states its own placement, so there is nothing left for
 * `restoreTo` to answer for it that `placement` does not already say.
 *
 * EVERY PANEL REACHES EVERY PLACEMENT, continuing the decision recorded here before this pass (see
 * the previous revision's own note on `BOTTOM_PANELS`): `allowed()` stays the one gate every caller
 * asks rather than assuming the answer, so a panel added later that genuinely cannot reach one
 * placement has one place to say so.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE PURE CORE. `openPanel` / `closePanel` / `movePanel` / `setPlacement` /
 * `resolveForViewport` take a `SlotLayout` explicitly and return a new one — no store, no
 * `localStorage`, no React. That is what makes "every panel × placement × slot" a table a test can
 * walk exhaustively.
 *
 * THE STORE, layered on top, is the per-browser preference (`localStorage`, key
 * `agentistics-panel-slots` — UNCHANGED from before this pass, so an existing reader's layout is
 * still found), never `/api/preferences` (shared by everyone signed in on a central). Guarded exactly
 * like `shellBand.ts`'s own `readBandPrefs`: a private window, cleared site data or a browser
 * blocking storage costs the memory, never the feature.
 *
 * MIGRATION. A value written by the OLD model (no `placement` field, a bare `right`/`bottom` id from
 * the five-id domain, `'contents'` among them) is detected and converted: whatever occupied `bottom`
 * there STAYS at the bottom (`studio`/`cli`/`shell`/`hardware`); `'contents'`, wherever it was, is
 * replaced by its ten descendants, all placed on the RAIL — the spec's own words, and deliberately
 * NOT "wherever contents was" pins the descendants: a `contents` that was docked at the bottom does
 * not imply the reader wanted ten tabs squeezed into a band which never held more than one occupant
 * before. An unreadable value, or one from a version this build does not recognise, falls back to the
 * plain defaults — never throws, never a half-applied layout.
 *
 * CLOSING (or DISPLACING) THE STUDIO ASKS FIRST when it holds unsaved buffers — the same question
 * `artifactsStore.closeArtifacts` already asks, through the same `unsavedBuffers.ts`. A MOVE never
 * asks: nothing is dropped by changing which slot shows a panel that stays mounted throughout.
