/**
 * homeTop.ts — PURE. The leaderboards on the home page: who led the PERIOD, and who leads TODAY.
 *
 * ## Why both readings, on every card
 *
 * A ranking over the filter's whole window answers "where does my money go", and it is stable —
 * which is exactly why it stops being news. Thirty days of history will not move because of what
 * happened this morning, so a card that only shows the period cannot answer the question people
 * actually open a dashboard with: *what is going on right now*. And a card that only shows today
 * throws away the context that makes today legible — a model at 1,2B tokens means nothing until you
 * know whether that is normal for it.
 *
 * So each board carries the period ranking and, under a rule, one line for the most recent day that
 * has any activity in the current filter. The day is NAMED rather than called "today", because with
 * a date filter on — or simply on a Monday morning — the last active day is frequently not today,
 * and a card labelled "today" showing Friday's numbers is a lie that is very easy to believe.
 *
 * ## The day rule here is the LOCAL day, deliberately
 *
 * This repo has two (see CLAUDE.md): billing uses the UTC `start_time.slice(0, 10)`, and the home's
 * own activity chart, heatmap and hour histogram bucket on the local clock. These cards sit beside
 * those charts, so they use the local day — a "peak hour" from `message_hours` (already local) sold
 * as belonging to a UTC day would put the evening's work on tomorrow's card at UTC-3.
