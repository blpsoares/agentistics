/**
 * repoApi.ts — the ONE module in the repository explorer that talks HTTP.
 *
 * It wraps the seven `/api/fleet/tree*` routes (`server/sessions/editor-web.ts`) and nothing else:
 * the tree view model (`repoTreeModel.ts`) is pure, the editor is lazy-loaded, and every component
 * reaches the network through here. Same posture as `packages/vscode/src/api.ts`, which this
 * mirrors deliberately — "the ONE process that talks HTTP; every method total".
 *
 * EVERY WRAPPER IS TOTAL, and answers with exactly one of THREE outcomes, never two:
 *  - a success, carrying the server's own fields;
 *  - a REFUSAL the server decided (`failure: 'refused'`), carrying its language-free `reason` code
 *    and its already-localized `message` VERBATIM;
 *  - `failure: 'unreachable'` — the request never got a usable answer (no network, a timeout, or a
 *    body that does not honour the contract).
 *
 * Nothing here throws at a caller, and NOTHING HERE COMPOSES A SENTENCE. The server already worded
 * every refusal in the user's own language (which is why `lang` travels on every request); mapping
 * a code to wording is a UI decision and is made where the wording is shown. A refusal whose body
 * carried no sentence at all — the closed gate's `{error: 'editor_disabled'}` — arrives here with
 * NO `message` field rather than an invented one, the same N/A-versus-a-confident-value rule this
 * codebase applies to harness capabilities.
 *
 * A failed call may never come back looking like an empty successful one. That is why the shape of
 * every `ok: true` body is checked before it is returned: a 200 that does not carry what it claims
 * would otherwise render as an empty directory, an empty search or an empty file — three confident
 * lies, each indistinguishable from a real result.
