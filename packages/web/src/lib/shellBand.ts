/**
 * shellBand.ts — PURE. The decisions the per-session shell band makes, kept out of the JSX.
 *
 * Three of them, and each is a rule the spec states rather than a preference:
 *
 *  - **The unwatch discipline** (`shellWatching`). The capture loop runs ONLY while the band is
 *    open, the session selected and the document visible. It is the only per-second cost this
 *    feature has — two tmux reads a second per watched pane — and `terminal-web.ts` already records
 *    the rule for the fleet's own channel: "capture is viewer-gated, so a surface that forgets to
 *    unwatch leaves a `capture-pane` loop running for a screen nobody can see."
 *  - **The geometry** (`clampBandHeight`). A drag may not shrink the band below a readable floor
 *    nor let it eat the conversation above it.
 *  - **The refusals** (`shellErrorText`). The route-level errors — the ones `index.ts` answers
 *    BEFORE `shell-web.ts` gets to compose a sentence — carry a CODE and no prose. The band must
 *    still say what happened: a blank pane is the confident-nothing this repo refuses everywhere
 *    else. `shell-web.ts`'s own refusals (`no-tmux`, `no-cwd`, `cwd-missing`, `at-cap`) already
 *    arrive as sentences and are shown verbatim; nothing here re-words them.
 *
 * The band's open/closed state and its height are a per-viewer convenience, so they live in
 * `localStorage` — the CLAUDE.md rule for exactly this kind of state — and every read and write is
 * guarded: a private window, cleared site data or a browser blocking storage makes the accessor
 * itself throw.

 * THROUGH — `resolveBandHeight`'s clamped `{height, full}` plus whether this same want ALSO crosses
 * into full screen, bundled so a band's move handler asks once rather than reaching into two
 * functions and risking they disagree about what `wantedPx` was measured against. `height`/`full`
 * never reflect the overshoot itself — they stay exactly what `resolveBandHeight` would have
 * answered alone (clamped at the column, sane) — which is what makes leaving full screen able to
 * fall back to THIS record rather than to the drag's own raw, possibly enormous number: the band was
 * never told to remember the overshoot in the first place.
 *
 * **THE INVARIANT THIS FUNCTION EXISTS TO STATE: `full` and the band's ACTUAL ON-SCREEN HEIGHT MAY
 * NEVER DISAGREE.** They did, for a release — not because this function was wrong (every number it
 * returns was, and is, correct — see `shellBand.test.ts`) but because the CALLER rendered `full` as
 * `flex: '1 1 auto'` on the band's own root, competing for space with the chat pane's OWN `flex: 1`
 * sibling instead of taking an explicit pixel height. Two `flex-grow: 1` items with different
 * `flex-basis` split the column by their CONTENT size, not by "give everything to the one that asked
 * to fill it" — measured on the real layout, a 700px column gave the band 381px and the chat 315px.
 * So a small incremental drag that reached the snap threshold made the band SHRINK on the very frame
 * it was told to fill the column ("aos poucos pra cima e atinjo o topo, ele volta pro meio"), the
 * next drag's own `startH` was read from `renderedHeight` (which correctly said "700", matching the
 * STATE this function had already resolved) while the box on screen was really 381px — so the same
 * finger movement that felt like a small further nudge computed as `startH + delta` against the
 * WRONG starting point and blew straight through `BAND_FULLSCREEN_OVERSHOOT_PX`, and true full
 * screen (a `position: fixed` overlay, immune to the flex competition) rendered correctly for the
 * first time in the whole gesture ("se eu tento redimensionar ele fica fullscreen"). Leaving it
 * (closing the band, which the header row's own click does) re-entered the SAME broken `full`
 * rendering path on the next open, with `heightPrefs` untouched throughout ("clico na barra ele
 * volta pro meio e fica bugado"). The fix is in the CALLER — `SessionPanel.tsx`'s `StudioBand` and
 * this file's own `ShellBand.tsx` now give the root an EXPLICIT height (`Math.max(BAND_MIN_PX,
 * renderedHeight)`, where `renderedHeight` already resolves to the column's own height while `full`)
 * instead of delegating to outer flex distribution, and give ONLY the CONTENT box inside it
 * `flex: '1 1 auto', minHeight: 0` to spend that height on. This function's own numbers were never
 * the bug and needed no change — the invariant lives here, in words, so the next caller of `full`
 * cannot reintroduce the mismatch by reaching for `flex-grow` again.
 *
 * THE SAME RESOLVER SERVES BOTH BANDS. `StudioBand` and `ShellBand` share one `BandPrefs` record
 * (`readBandPrefs`/`writeBandPrefs`, the `agentistics-shell-band` key) and now share this one
 * function for what a drag on either of their handles means — a second, hand-rolled copy in
 * `ShellBand.tsx` is exactly the drift this repository's own CLAUDE.md exists to prevent. Where the
 * two differ is only in WHAT "full screen" does once requested: `StudioBand` owns a `fullscreen`
 * flag (`SessionsPage`'s `studioFullscreen`, a `position: fixed` overlay `Studio.tsx`'s own gear
 * menu can also reach); `ShellBand` has no overlay of its own and instead navigates to the pane's
 * DEDICATED screen (`onOpenFullscreen`) when one is offered — the same escalation, aimed at whichever
 * "full screen" that band actually has.
