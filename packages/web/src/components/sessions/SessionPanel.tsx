/**
 * SessionPanel — one selected session, as a terminal or as a conversation.
 *
 * The two views answer different questions and neither replaces the other. The TERMINAL is the
 * whole truth: everything the assistant draws, tool output included, and the only place a dialog
 * can be answered. The CHAT is the readable half: what was actually said, with the box drawing and
 * the status strip gone.
 *
 * So the toggle is per session and it defaults to CHAT where a chat can exist and to TERMINAL where
 * it cannot. Where it cannot, the Chat segment is ABSENT rather than disabled — a control that is
 * present and refuses teaches nothing, while its absence plus the sentence in the panel says which
 * harnesses can do this and why yours cannot.
 *
 * ON DESKTOP this panel draws NO header of its own any more — the title, the Chat/Terminal tabs and
 * the "···" actions moved UP into the shared sticky header in `App.tsx`, right below the fleet's
 * filter bar. Two bordered strips stacked on top of each other said the same thing twice; one strip
 * is the whole point of sharing a header with the filters at all. `view`/`onViewChange` being
 * PROVIDED is the signal that the caller is showing that shared header (desktop): this component
 * then reads the view instead of owning it and renders no header. On MOBILE, where the shared header
 * is hidden for lack of room, this panel is still fully self-contained — `SessionsPage`'s mobile
 * branch passes neither prop, and the header below returns.

          stream is: those routes are the machine's own and a central refuses them outright, so a
          band there could only ever draw a refusal (`bar-only`, or `none` on a phone — untouched by
          this fix, see `bottomBandFor`'s own doc comment).

          THE STUDIO CAN OCCUPY THIS SAME BAND (`lib/panelSlots.ts`'s `bottom` slot), and when it
          does this renders a SEPARATE small band rather than teaching `ShellBand` a third target:
          `ShellBand` bundles the session's own pane and the shell because both are terminal STREAMS
          answering the one consent/geometry machinery in `lib/terminalSurface.ts` — the Studio is
          neither, and its own persistent host (`StudioHost`, mounted once by `SessionsPage`) is what
          must never be torn down by an ordinary collapse. `key={session.id}` still resets the band's
          own open/collapsed feel per session; the Studio's own mount lives one level up. */}
