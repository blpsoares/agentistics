/**
 * shellBandFullPerPanel.lint.test.ts — `ShellBand` reads/writes ONLY its own panel's full-screen
 * entry, never the shared `agentistics-shell-band` record's `full` flag as a bare boolean.
 *
 * Companion to `sessionPanel.lint.test.ts`'s own describe block of the same name, for the third
 * consumer of `BandPrefs.full` (`StudioBand` and `SimpleDockedBand` are the other two, both in
 * `SessionPanel.tsx`). `ShellBand` shows either the session's `cli` pane or its `shell` one, chosen
 * by its own `target` state — so "this panel's entry" is `target` itself, read through
 * `bandPanelFull(prefs, target)` and written through `withBandPanelFull(merged, target, ...)`,
 * never a bare `prefs.full`.
 *
 * Not reachable by rendering: `ShellBand` needs a live tmux session and `packages/web` has no
 * jsdom. The SHAPE is what went wrong (one flat boolean, shared by whichever panel next reads it —
 * drag the Studio to fill the column, move Contents into the same band, and Contents read as full
 * too), so the shape is what is asserted, over comment-free source, with the old shape planted back
 * in to prove the scan still catches it.

/**
 * `open` MOUNTS SEEDED FROM `slotLayout.bottomOpen` — the sibling bug to the one above, found by
 * the same agent: with the band open on the Studio, picking Claude Code or Shell minimized it
 * instead of switching, needing a second click. `ShellBand` mounts fresh whenever it swaps in for
 * `StudioBand`/`SimpleDockedBand`, and `useState(() => readBandPrefs())` used to read the shared
 * record's `open` field cold, ignoring the `bottomOpen: true` `panelSlots.ts`'s own `openPanel` had
 * just set for the panel now mounting. `seedBandOpen` (`shellBand.ts`, pure — its own tests cover
 * the arithmetic) is the fix; this file owns only the WIRING — that the seed actually reaches the
 * `useState` initializer and the shell-resolution reducer's own mount-time read.
