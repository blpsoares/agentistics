/**
 * bandControls.tsx — ONE height, ONE padding, ONE icon/label size for every control drawn on the
 * bottom band's own bar, the right slot's fixed-header switcher and the Studio bar (design item 3,
 * screenshot 1 — "the buttons are non-standard sizes and it is very confusing").
 *
 * BEFORE THIS FILE, the same idea existed at least THREE times and had already drifted from itself:
 * `ShellBand.tsx`'s `labeledBtn` (a bordered pill, height 22, no `boxSizing`, so its rendered box was
 * really 24px once the 1px border either side is added back), `SessionPanel.tsx`'s
 * `studioBandLabeledBtn`/`studioBandIconBtn` (byte-for-byte copies of the same numbers, kept as a
 * SECOND definition rather than an import), and `Studio.tsx`'s `LabeledIconButton` (the same 22px
 * height, but `border: 'none'` and `background: 'transparent'` — a ghost button standing next to
 * bordered pills of a different actual height). None of the three disagreed on purpose; they just
 * never shared a body. `SessionPanel.tsx` even exported a `Segment` component with a comment saying
 * exactly this ("a second hand-rolled copy of it is exactly the drift this whole lift-up was meant
 * to remove") and then nothing ever imported it — `ShellBand.tsx`'s own segmented tablists
 * (`targetSwitch`/`dockedTargetSwitch`) hand-rolled their buttons anyway.
 *
 * THE FIX IS `boxSizing: 'border-box'` PLUS AN EXPLICIT `height` ON EVERY BOX THAT CAN CARRY ONE —
 * including the segment's own WRAPPER, not only the pills beside it. A wrapper sized by its content
 * (`padding: 3` around a 22px button) measures 28px tall while a standalone pill beside it measures
 * 22-24px: same "control", visibly different heights, which is the whole complaint. Fixing the
 * wrapper's height explicitly and giving its tabs `height: '100%'` is what makes
 * `getBoundingClientRect().height` agree across every control this file exports.

 * bar row's SIBLING placed AFTER it, inside a `{open && (…)}` fragment — one row lower, level with
 * the toolbar, because that is genuinely where it sat in the DOM. Three copies that happened to
 * agree only for one of the three panels is not a rule, it is a coincidence; this component is the
 * rule, and every caller now renders it before its own bar row (see `StudioBand`/`SimpleDockedBand`/
 * `ShellBand`'s own docked branch).
 *
 * Presentation only — `useBandDrag` below is the one state machine that decides WHAT a drag on it
 * means; this component never reads `columnHeight` or persists anything itself, so a caller cannot
 * forget to gate it on `open`/`fullscreen` and get away with a HANDLE that draws but does nothing.

/**
 * useBandDropTarget — THE WHOLE BOTTOM BAND, made a drop target (fixing "nao ta dando pra arrastar
 * da barra da direita ate a barra inferior, so da barra inferior pra barra da direita").
 *
 * THE ACTUAL BUG, found by reproducing the owner's own gesture (press the rail icon, drag across
 * the screen, release over the band) rather than by a precise element-to-element test: only
 * `PanelBar`'s own `<BandSegment>` — the small pill-shaped tab strip inside each band's header row
 * — was ever wired as a drop target (`onDrop`, gated on `dropHere`, in `PanelBar` above). Everything
 * ELSE the band visibly covers — the terminal stream, the Studio's file tree, the resize grip, the
 * empty space around the pill — had no drag handling AT ALL, so a drop landing anywhere but that
 * one small strip was silently ignored. `bottom → rail` never had this problem because the RAIL's
 * own drop target is its ENTIRE column (`PanelRail.tsx`'s outer `role="tablist"` div plus every
 * icon inside it) — there is no narrow pill to miss there. Verified live: dropping precisely onto
 * the bottom band's own tab strip already worked before this fix; dropping onto the Studio's file
 * tree three rows below it, which is what "the bottom band" looks like to someone not aiming at a
 * specific pixel, did nothing at all.
 *
 * `StudioBand`, `SimpleDockedBand` and `ShellBand`'s docked branch each spread this onto their own
 * OUTERMOST element — the same root box whose height they are already measuring for the resize
 * handle — so a drop anywhere within the band's visible bounds resolves as "dropped on this bar"
 * (`{ placement: 'bottom' }`), the same target a drop on the tab strip's own empty space already
 * produced. `onDrop` is OPTIONAL, same convention as `PanelBar`'s: a caller that never wires it
 * renders a band with no drop handling, exactly as before.
 *
 * NATIVE LISTENERS, NEVER REACT PROPS (rail-loose-ends, item 2) — and this is not a style choice,
 * it is the only thing that actually reaches an OPEN Studio's Monaco surface. `StudioHost.tsx`
 * carries the Studio's own DOM node through `createPortal`, physically `appendChild`-ed into
 * whichever slot currently shows it (`StudioBand`'s own `contentRef`) — the standard "portal into a
 * node you move yourself" trick, load-bearing for keeping Monaco's buffers alive across a move. Per
 * React's own documented portal contract, a **synthetic** event fired inside that portal bubbles
 * through the portal's REACT ancestry (`StudioHost` → `SessionsPage`, where it is mounted as a
 * SIBLING of `StudioBand`, never a descendant) — NOT through the DOM ancestry a reader can see on
 * screen. So `onDrop`/`onDropCapture` react props on `StudioBand`'s own root, however they are
 * phrased, can NEVER fire for an event that originated inside the Studio's portaled content: React
 * is not even looking at that subtree when it walks the fiber tree for this dispatch, regardless of
 * where the DOM node has been moved to. Verified two ways: (1) `onDrop` (bubble, the pre-fix shape)
 * never reached this root from Monaco's surface, matching the swallowed-drop report exactly; (2)
 * `onDropCapture` (capture, the FIRST fix attempted here) did not reach it either, even after
 * disabling the one Monaco feature that was originally blamed (`dropIntoEditor`) — ruling out "some
 * descendant calls stopPropagation" as the explanation, since a capture listener on an ANCESTOR runs
 * before any descendant gets a chance regardless. A raw `element.addEventListener(type, fn, true)`
 * on this SAME root node, by contrast, sees the event correctly (confirmed directly), because it
 * follows the real DOM tree the portal was physically moved into — exactly where the reader's mouse
 * is. So this hook now attaches genuine native listeners to the band's root via a ref, in the
 * capture phase, instead of returning JSX props — the DOM tree is the one thing every panel's
 * content, portaled or not, actually shares with this band, and native listeners are the only thing
 * that reads it. `StudioBand`/`SimpleDockedBand`/`ShellBand`'s docked branch each pass `ref` to
 * their own OUTERMOST element instead of spreading `handlers` — `SimpleDockedBand`'s own children
 * are plain React descendants (never portaled), so this fix changes nothing about how they behave,
 * only how the listener is attached.
 *
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE BAND'S OWN TAB STRIP (`role="tablist"`), and it is excluded ON PURPOSE:
 * `PanelBar`'s own tabs already resolve a POSITIONED drop (spec §3 — "drop precisely on a tab" lands
 * the panel next to that tab, not merely appended) through their own bubble-phase `onDrop` +
 * `stopPropagation` (`BandSegmentTab`, below — genuine React children, not portaled, so React's own
 * bubble dispatch reaches them exactly as documented), and `BandSegment`'s own wrapper already
 * resolves a drop on the strip's blank space the identical way `PanelBar` always has. Capturing
 * ahead of THOSE would consume the event before either one ever got to run, collapsing every
 * positioned drop into a plain append — the exact defect `[planted-revert coverage]` pins in
 * `panelSlots.test.ts` for the pure arithmetic, now true of the DOM wiring too if this exclusion
 * were dropped. So the native drop listener defers (returns without acting) whenever the event's
 * target sits inside a `[role="tablist"]`, letting it fall through to the tab strip's own React
 * handlers exactly as before this pass. `dragover` still marks the WHOLE band highlighted while a
 * drag is over ANY of it, tab strip included — "what lights up is exactly what accepts the drop"
 * (`StudioBand`'s own header) — it only skips `stopPropagation` there, so the tab strip's own
 * per-tab highlight keeps working underneath it.
 *
 * GUARDED BY `hasDragPayload`, never by droppability alone: a FOREIGN drag (an OS file, browser
 * text) is left entirely alone — no `preventDefault`, no `stopPropagation` — so this never turns
 * off some other drop behaviour a panel's content might genuinely want for a drag this app did not
 * originate.

 * PanelFixedControls — the ONE cluster of per-panel controls (owner, 2026-09-19: "botões que
 * ficaram fixos pra qualquer aba que for aberta: tela cheia, minimizar... vamos ter apenas 1 icone
 * de engrenagem, ele sera o responsavel pelas configurações das abas de cada uma em individual").
 * Every panel that draws its own chrome — the bottom band's own bar (`ShellBand`, and the new
 * Contents/Hardware bands), the right slot's small header (`SessionsPage`'s `rightSlotBar`), and
 * the Studio's own toolbar in the right slot (`Studio.tsx`) — renders THIS, in THIS fixed order,
 * so a reader never has to relearn where a control lives from one panel to the next:
 *
 *   [full screen, only where offered] → [minimize, ALWAYS] → [pin, right-slot panels only]
 *   → [gear, only with something to say]
 *
 * PIN (narrow-overlay pass, 2026-09-22, spec §11) — "quero em todos um botao de pin que fica ativo
 * e salvo como preferencia". `pinned` is `undefined` wherever this cluster is NOT drawing a
 * right-slot header — the bottom band's own bar (`ShellBand`, `SimpleDockedBand`) and the Studio's
 * bottom-docked toolbar never pass it, because §11 item 4 is explicit: "The rail only. The bottom
 * band keeps today's behaviour exactly." Present, it is a toggle whose PRESSED state is the pin's
 * own glyph swap (`Pin`, filled when active via `fill: currentColor` — never colour alone, which a
 * colour-blind reader could miss) so pinned-ness is visible at a glance on the row itself, not only
 * in the tooltip. `panelSlots.ts`'s own `pinned` record is what this reads/writes; see that
 * module's header for what CLEARS it (moving the panel off the rail).
 *
 * FULL SCREEN IS NEVER A MENU ROW ANY MORE. It used to be a row inside the same "⋯"/gear menu that
 * also offered move and close, which is what let a reader miss it entirely under two clicks for a
 * control the owner wanted reachable in one. `fullscreen` is `undefined` wherever a panel/slot pair
 * genuinely has nowhere to send it (never present and refusing) — see `fullscreenModeFor` in
 * `lib/panelMenu.ts` for which panels can and cannot.
 *
 * MINIMIZE IS THE LITERAL `−` WHILE THE PANEL IS OPEN, AND AN UP CHEVRON WHILE IT IS COLLAPSED.
 * The `−` came from the owner ("o minimizar laranja vira um `−` literal"), and for one release it was
 * drawn in BOTH states on the window-control reading that minimize never signals current state. On
 * a collapsed bottom band that meant a minimize button on a bar that was already minimized, which
 * the owner reported twice ("o - ainda aparece na barra mesmo com ela fechada"). The callers already
 * switched the LABEL to "Expandir" while collapsed; the glyph now agrees with its own label, and
 * matches what the owner asked for before the `−` existed: "setinha pra cima pra abrir". ALWAYS THE ACCENT
 * ORANGE — never the neutral secondary-text colour every other icon in this file uses, and never
 * buried in the gear. `collapsed` is kept as a prop (some callers still read it for their OWN
 * layout) but no longer changes this glyph. It does NOT decide whether the control is
 * drawn — a panel that can only ever be told to go away (the four right-slot panels that close
 * outright, `panelMenu.ts`'s own `close-right`) simply never reads `collapsed: true`, since there
 * is nothing left on screen to reopen it from once it has gone. `onMinimize` is OPTIONAL for
 * exactly ONE caller (`Studio.tsx`'s own toolbar, bottom-docked): `StudioBand`'s own outer bar
 * ALREADY draws this exact control there (`panelMenu.ts`'s `collapse-bottom`), so a second one here
 * would be the same duplication this whole feature exists to remove — see that call site's own
 * comment. Every other caller always provides it.
 *
 * THE GEAR HOLDS WHATEVER IS LEFT — move, close, panel-specific settings — and is ABSENT, never a
 * disabled trigger, when `gearEntries` is empty (`BandOverflowMenu`'s own rule).

 * that way without a second, bespoke keyboard path to drift from the pointer one.
 *
 * PORTALED, `position: fixed`, ANCHORED TO THE TRIGGERING ELEMENT'S OWN RECT rather than
 * `event.clientX/clientY` — a keyboard-fired `contextmenu` reports those inconsistently across
 * browsers (often 0,0 or the viewport corner), while the element's `getBoundingClientRect()` is
 * always where the reader is actually looking. Portaled for the same reason the rail's own tooltip
 * is now portaled: the rail's `overflow: hidden` would otherwise clip a menu opening to its left.

 * (`App.tsx`'s `allTiles.map`): a square, an icon, a title, ONE extra line — here the panel's own
 * description instead of that sheet's badge, since these tiles answer "what is this panel" rather
 * than "how many of something does it hold."
 *
 * Closes on pick, on `Esc`, and on a click outside — spec §4's own three rules, shared by §5's list
 * since nothing about "why" the list is showing changes how it should close.
 *
 * Anchored to the TRIGGER's own rect (`at`), never the click point — same reasoning as
 * `PanelContextMenu`'s own header: a keyboard-opened dropdown has no meaningful click point, and the
 * rail's `overflow: hidden` would clip this in place exactly as it clipped the tooltip before that
 * bug was fixed, so this is portaled the same way.
