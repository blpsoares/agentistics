/**
 * sessionPanel.lint.test.ts — `StudioBand`'s content box may never sit inside a non-growing wrapper
 * (the freeze this pins).
 *
 * `StudioBand` (`SessionPanel.tsx`) shares its "snap to fill the column" geometry with `ShellBand`
 * (`resolveBandHeight`, `shellBand.ts`) — dragging the handle near the column's own top edge sets
 * `heightPrefs.full`, and the band's ROOT then reads `flex: '1 1 auto'` to stretch and fill it.
 *
 * The content box (the one the Studio's own portal carrier — `contentRef` — lives inside) used to
 * sit wrapped, together with the resize handle, in an EXTRA `<div style={{display:'flex',
 * flexDirection: 'column'}}>` with no `flex`/`minHeight` of its own. That div is a flex ITEM of the
 * root, and with no `flex` it takes only the height its CONTENT asks for (`flex: 0 1 auto`, the CSS
 * default) instead of growing into whatever the root — which DOES stretch when `full` — actually had
 * to give it. The content box's own `flex: '1 1 auto'` then had nothing to grow INTO (a flex-grow
 * child cannot exceed a non-growing parent), so the whole thing collapsed to its minimum size and the
 * root's remaining ~400px sat empty below it.
 *
 * MEASURED live, before the fix: dragging the handle to the column's top DID grow the root (its own
 * `getBoundingClientRect().height` read 469px, `flex: 1 1 auto` correctly applied) while the box
 * carrying `data-studio-layout` measured `height: 0` — the tree and the editor rendered into a
 * sliver at the top of the band and the rest sat blank, which is what read as "the band went
 * empty… and never became full screen." `ShellBand` never had this bug: its own content box is a
 * direct child of ITS root, with no such wrapper.
 *
 * THIS FILE WAS UPDATED for the band-grip-position fix (owner: "o item de reposicionamento muda de
 * lugar dependendo da aba, deveria estar sempre no topo"). The resize handle no longer shares a
 * Fragment with the content box at all — it moved OUT, to render ABOVE the bar row through the
 * shared `BandResizeHandle` (`bandControls.tsx`), which is what `bandGripPosition.lint.test.ts`
 * pins. What is left for THIS file to guard is narrower but unchanged in spirit: the content box
 * itself must still be a direct, un-wrapped flex item of the root — the freeze this file exists for
 * is about THAT box, never about where the handle happens to sit.
 *
 * Not reachable by rendering: `StudioBand` is not exported (there is no seam to mount it through),
 * and this package has no jsdom regardless. The SHAPE is what went wrong, so the shape is what is
 * asserted, over comment-free source, with the defect planted below to prove the scan still sees it.
