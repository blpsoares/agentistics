/**
 * PanelRail — the icon rail on the right edge of the sessions workspace (right-rail spec §2).
 *
 * ALWAYS PRESENT ON DESKTOP, icons only, VS Code's activity bar. `panels` is already filtered and
 * ordered by the caller (`panelSlots.railPanels`, with whatever server/per-session gates apply —
 * `hardwareOffered`, `editorEnabled`, `relayed` — already subtracted): this component draws exactly
 * what it is given and decides nothing about which panels exist.
 *
 * CLICKING opens that panel in the content area to the rail's OWN LEFT — this component never
 * decides where that content renders, only that `onOpen(id)` was asked for; the caller
 * (`SessionsPage.tsx`) is what keeps the content area from ever painting UNDER the rail (the rail is
 * a flex sibling with a fixed width, never absolutely positioned over anything).
 *
 * HOVER NAMES THE ICON, AND SO DOES KEYBOARD FOCUS (spec §2). A native `title` attribute would
 * satisfy the first alone — most browsers show it only on a POINTER hover, never on `:focus` — so
 * this draws its own tooltip, shown on `mouseenter`/`focus` alike and hidden on the matching leave/
 * blur, positioned to the LEFT of the rail (the rail sits at the screen's own right edge, so a
 * tooltip opening rightward would run off-screen). It carries the TITLE and a one-line DESCRIPTION
 * (addendum item 1: "nao ta aparecendo o cardzinho explicativo").
 *
 * PORTALED TO `document.body`, `position: fixed`, measured off the hovered button's own rect —
 * NEVER `position: absolute` inside this component's tree. It was, once, and shipped invisible: the
 * rail's own `overflow: hidden` (immediately below, load-bearing for "the rail never scrolls its
 * icons") clips ANY descendant whose box extends outside the rail's bounds, which the tooltip does
 * BY DESIGN — it opens 8px to the tooltip's own LEFT of a 44px-wide column, i.e. entirely outside
 * it. Clipping is a layout/paint fact, not a stacking-context one, so no `z-index` could have
 * rescued it. This is why it "worked in the preview and failed in production": it never actually
 * worked — the phase-1 verification confirmed the tooltip NODE existed (right text, right DOM) and
 * never confirmed it was PAINTED, so a bug present in dev from the start went unnoticed until a
 * real hover in the shipped build showed nothing. `SessionsGroupMenu.tsx`'s own popover already
 * solves the identical problem the identical way — `createPortal` + `position: fixed` — this
 * follows that established pattern rather than inventing a second one.
 *
 * NEVER SCROLLS (spec §4: "The rail never scrolls its icons: overflow is the dropdown, not a
 * scrollbar") — that dropdown is a LATER pass; for now a rail taller than its column simply clips
 * (`overflow: hidden`), which is the honest incomplete state rather than a scrollbar this design
 * explicitly rules out.
 *
 * DRAG (spec §3), mouse only — it reaches neither the keyboard nor a phone, which is exactly why the
 * gear's move verbs stay clickable everywhere this drag can reach and everywhere it cannot. Dragging
 * one icon onto another REORDERS the rail; dragging an icon here from the BOTTOM band (or anywhere
 * else carrying the shared drag payload — `dragReorder.ts`'s `DRAG_KEY_TYPE`) MOVES it onto the
 * rail. This component only ever reports "this key was dropped on that target" — `onDrop` decides
 * what that means, via the pure `planPanelDrop`; the DOM layer holds no order arithmetic of its own,
 * only which icon is being dragged/hovered, for the drop-target highlight.
 *
 * OVERFLOW (spec §4). `panels` can hold more entries than the rail's own measured height can show —
 * `fitRailIcons` (`lib/railFit.ts`, pure, tested) decides the split, this component only measures
 * the icon COLUMN's own height (a `ResizeObserver`, so it reacts to the window resizing) and reads
 * the split back. The overflowing tail collapses into ONE "more" control at the end of the visible
 * icons, carrying how many are behind it; picking it opens a `PanelTileDropdown` (shared with the
 * eye, below) whose tiles are icon + title + description, exactly like the mobile "More" sheet's own
 * tiles. The rail never grows a scrollbar for this — `overflow: hidden` on the icon column stays.
 *
 * HIDING AND THE CONFIG AREA (spec §5). Right-click → "Ocultar" (added to the SAME context menu the
 * move verb already opened) sends a panel to `hidden` — no icon anywhere. The rail's own END is a
 * config area, visually separated from the icon column (a top border), holding ONE control: an eye,
 * present only while `hidden.length > 0`. It opens the SAME `PanelTileDropdown`, listing the hidden
 * panels with a "Restaurar"/"Restore" verb per tile — the only way back, so it must never itself be
 * unreachable, which is why it lives in the config area rather than behind the icon list's own
 * overflow (a hidden panel could otherwise hide the very control that recovers it).
 *
 * THE RESIZABLE WIDTH (owner, 2026-09-21: "aumentar POUCA COISA da largura dele, dai isso aumenta os
 * icones tbm"). A small vertical grip sits centred on the rail's OWN LEFT EDGE — the same
 * `ResizeGrip` family the aside's own vertical divider and the bottom band's top edge already use,
 * so a reader who has learned one drag handle recognises this one. The drag is a bare clamp
 * (`clampRailWidth`, `lib/railFit.ts`) with no snapping and no escalation to anything — unlike
 * `useBandDrag`'s height, there is no "full screen" a rail can grow into, so the range stays the
 * narrow one `railFit.ts`'s own header explains (floor to `floor * 1.5`). The icon size is DERIVED
 * (`railIconSize`), never a second stored number, so it cannot drift from the width that produced
 * it. Persistence is `setRailWidth`'s own job (`panelSlots.ts`) — this component only ever reports
 * the pointer's current position; the clamp-and-commit-and-write happens once, in the pure layer.

          this module's own header for the clipping bug this replaced (`overflow: hidden` above
          clipped the old in-tree version entirely, in every build, dev included).

          A WIDE, SHORT RECTANGLE (owner, 2026-09-21: "um retangulo horizontal mano") — v2.46.0's
          card had no `minWidth`, only a `maxWidth: 220`, and a `position: fixed` box with no
          explicit width shrinks to its own content's PREFERRED width rather than growing out to
          the max — for a short title next to a long description that preferred width came out
          under half of 220px, so the description wrapped one or two words per line into a tall
          column instead of the wide card the max-width was meant to allow. `minWidth` fixes the
          shape; the title is now `nowrap` (never wraps, a panel's name is always short enough to
          say on one line) and the description is a 2-line CLAMP (`-webkit-line-clamp`), so the
          card's HEIGHT stays fixed regardless of which panel is hovered — never "grows taller",
          the owner's other complaint about the tall version.

          CLAMPED AGAINST THE VIEWPORT'S TOP AND BOTTOM, measured rather than guessed: `tooltipTop`
          starts `null` (naive vertical centering, `transform`'s own `translateY(-50%)`) and a
          `useLayoutEffect` — synchronous, before the browser ever paints the frame — measures the
          card's OWN rendered height once mounted and recomputes a clamped `top`, dropping the
          transform once it has one. A hover near the very top or bottom rail icon on a short
          window is exactly the case a purely-CSS centered tooltip would push off-screen. */}
