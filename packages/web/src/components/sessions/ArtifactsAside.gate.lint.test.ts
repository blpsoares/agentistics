/**
 * THE STUDIO IS ABSENT FROM `ArtifactsAside.tsx` — asserted over its own source.
 *
 * It used to be a MODE of this panel (`studio` state, a `Layer` at the component's root, a `StripId`
 * outside `TabId`) — one open flag shared by two components, so opening the Studio lit the Contents
 * button beside it. The Studio is now its own PANEL (`lib/panelSlots.ts`'s `studio`), rendered by
 * `StudioHost.tsx` and placed independently on the rail or at the bottom.
 *
 * AFTER THE RIGHT ICON RAIL (2026-09-21), `contents` itself stopped existing as a container: the
 * strip and the launcher grid this file used to draw (`const tabs:`, `pickStrip`, `TabGrid`,
 * `StripId`) are GONE — each former tab is its own mount now, driven by the CONTROLLED `activeTab`
 * prop (`TabId`, a local alias of `panelSlots.ts`'s own `TabPanelId`). What survives from the
 * original invariant, updated for that shape:
 *
 *  1. This component imports neither `Layer` nor `Studio` — reaching for either here is reaching for
 *     the old architecture.
 *  2. `TabId` (this file's local alias of `TabPanelId`) carries no `'studio'` member.
 *  3. Nothing in the render dispatch, or the focus-request effect, ever names `'studio'`.
 *  4. `editorEnabled` / `editorAutosave` are gone from `ArtifactsAsideProps` — they gated the Studio
 *     alone, and this component has nothing left to gate.
 *
 * There is no jsdom and no `@testing-library/react` here, so none of it is reachable by rendering:
 * the source is what there is to assert against, in the shape `monacoEntry.lint.test.ts` and
 * `tokens.lint.test.ts` already use here.
 *
 * **COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST.** The file names `Studio` and `editorEnabled` in prose throughout —
 * explaining why they are gone — so a raw grep would be satisfied by the very comment recording the
 * fix. `lib/stripComments.ts` is the one stripper this repo trusts for exactly that reason.
