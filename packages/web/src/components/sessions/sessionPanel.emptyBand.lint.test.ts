/**
 * sessionPanel.emptyBand.lint.test.ts — AN EMPTY BAND RENDERS NOTHING, in `SimpleDockedBand` too.
 *
 * Owner report: "na barra inferior ta aparecendo eternamente o - de minimizar" — a screenshot of an
 * otherwise empty bottom strip carrying a lone orange `−`. `PanelBarBand` already carries this rule
 * (`if (barEntries.length === 0) return null`, owner, 2026-09-21: "quando removo todos os itens ele
 * simplesmente deixa essa porra desse iconezinho feio ai"), but that guard was written for the
 * RELAYED case alone and `SimpleDockedBand` never got the same one.
 *
 * THE LEAK: `bottomBandFor` (`lib/panelBar.ts`) selects a band for `bottomOccupant` "whatever panel
 * it is, gated or not" (that function's own doc comment) — `resolveForGates` only clears a stored
 * `bottom` occupant for the three MACHINE-level `PanelGates` (`editorEnabled`/`shellEnabled`/
 * `relayed`). `hardware`'s own gate is per-SESSION (`hardwareOffered`), read only at the render
 * layer and never by `resolveForGates` (`panelSlots.ts`'s own `gateOpen`, which does not mention
 * `hardware` at all). So a browser that once docked Hardware at the bottom on an ordinary machine,
 * now pointed at a CENTRAL (`hardwareOffered` always false there), keeps `bottomOccupant ===
 * 'hardware'`; `bottomBandFor` still returns `'hardware'`; `panelBarEntries` filters the one entry
 * this band would have shown. `SimpleDockedBand` mounted anyway — its grip, its (now empty)
 * `PanelBar`, and `PanelFixedControls`' own literal `−` (that component's own header: "ALWAYS THE
 * SAME LITERAL `−`") all drawn with nothing docked behind any of them.
 *
 * `StudioBand` was checked and is NOT reachable the same way: `studio`'s own gate (`editorEnabled`)
 * IS one of the three `resolveForGates` clears, so a stored `bottom: 'studio'` never survives a
 * closed `editorEnabled` gate to reach `bottomBandFor` at all — confirmed by `panelSlots.ts`'s own
 * `gateOpen` naming `studio` explicitly. Its own minimize is a plain `ChevronDown`/`ChevronUp`
 * button besides (not `PanelFixedControls`' literal `−`), so it could not be the control the
 * screenshot shows even if it were reachable.
 *
 * Not reachable by rendering: `SimpleDockedBand` is not exported (no seam to mount it through — see
 * `sessionPanel.lint.test.ts`'s own header for the same fact about `StudioBand`), and this package
 * has no jsdom regardless. The SHAPE is what is asserted, over comment-free source, with a planted
 * reversion proving the scan still sees the bug this pins.
