/**
 * ShellBand — a real shell, in the selected session's own folder, docked as the LAST band of the
 * session panel.
 *
 * It is called **Shell**, not Terminal, and that is not fussiness: the session header already
 * carries a `Chat | Terminal` toggle, and that "Terminal" is the ASSISTANT'S own screen — the tmux
 * pane `claude` is drawing in, where a permission dialog is answered. Two controls named Terminal
 * on one panel, doing different things, is an ambiguity nobody untangles on their own.
 *
 * ## What is reused, and what is new
 *
 * Everything that renders and drives a tmux pane in this browser already exists and is already
 * hardened: `SessionTerminal` (the lazily-chunked xterm), `useTerminalStream` (SSE + the honesty
 * line), `useTerminalWrite` (the ordered WS write channel with its per-key acks). This component
 * points all three at the SHELL scope — `lib/terminalEndpoint.ts` owns which routes that means —
 * and adds the two things a shell needs that a session does not: the band geometry, and the mobile
 * key strip.
 *
 * ## The unwatch discipline
 *
 * The capture loop runs ONLY while the band is open, this session is the selected one, and the
 * document is visible. It is the only per-second cost this feature has, and it is `shellWatching`'s
 * one job; `useTerminalStream(null)` is what actually drops the subscription, after which the
 * server's hub stops capturing as its last reader leaves. Collapsing the band, switching session
 * (the component is keyed by session, so it unmounts) or backgrounding the tab all stop it.
 *
 * ## Consent
 *
 * There is no arm/disarm here, unlike the fleet terminal's composer. OPENING the shell is the
 * consent — a person pressed a button that spawned `$SHELL` in a directory they named — and the
 * server refused the whole route unless `CAPS.localShell` and the `shellEnabled` switch both stand.
 * A second gate on top of that would be ceremony, not safety.
 *
 * ## Refusals
 *
 * `/api/shell/open` answers a REFUSAL as a 200 carrying a sentence (`no-tmux`, `no-cwd`,
 * `cwd-missing`, `at-cap`) — shown verbatim, never re-worded here. The route-level errors upstream
 * of it (`shell_disabled`, `shell_central`) carry a CODE and no prose, and `shellErrorText` is the
 * one place that turns those into sentences. A blank band is never an answer.
