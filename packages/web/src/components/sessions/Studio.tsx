/**
 * Studio — Agentistics Studio's own root: the tree, the search and a multi-tab Monaco editor, as
 * LAYERS over one panel rather than a split.
 *
 * IT IS A MODE, NOT A TAB, and that is the one thing to understand before changing anything here.
 * It began as one tab among the aside's fourteen, under the aside's own "Contents" header and its
 * tab strip — two rows of chrome above a file tree and a code editor, in a column 440px wide. A
 * tree plus an editor cannot share vertical space with that, so opening the Studio now REPLACES the
 * aside's chrome: `ArtifactsAside` renders this component as a `Layer` at its own root, over the
 * header and the strip, at the full size of the aside. The way back is this component's OWN top
 * edge (`onExit`), which is the only chrome there is here — and it is a required prop rather than an
 * optional one, because an exit that can be forgotten is a reader trapped in a panel.
 *
 * The name is the PRODUCT's, deliberately: Agentistics Studio, the studio of this product. It is
 * not "agent studio", which reads as a studio for building agents and is a different thing. The
 * modules under it keep their repository names (`repoApi`, `repoTreeModel`, `RepoTreeView`,
 * `RepoFileEditor`, …): those describe what they read, which really is a repository.
 *
 * THE TREE STAYS BESIDE THE EDITOR, and that is what `StudioBody` is for. Opening a file used to
 * REPLACE the tree with the editor, so reading one file and looking for the next were two modes you
 * moved between — asked about in those words: "quero tbm que quando um arquivo for aberto tenhamos
 * uma barra aqui redimensionavel e minimizavel que ainda mostra a arvore de arquivos pra eu poder
 * continuar navegando e explorando eles". So a file open on a wide enough panel puts the tree in a
 * column of its own on the left, DRAGGABLE and collapsible, with the editor beside it.
 *
 * IT IS A LAYOUT, NOT A SECOND COMPOSITION. Both panes are the same two `Layer`s that were stacked
 * before; `studioLayout` decides only whether they sit side by side or on top of each other, and
 * every rule below — what stays mounted, what hides and how — is untouched by that choice. A split
 * that built its own panes would be a second place for the mounting rules to be got wrong.
 *
 * `layers` IS STILL THE ANSWER IN TWO CASES, and neither is a fallback for the other. A PHONE has
 * one column: a tree and an editor sharing 390px is two things doing neither job, so there the
 * panes stay stacked and the open-files strip is what moves between them. And a panel too NARROW to
 * hold both minima (`SPLIT_MIN`) degrades the same way rather than shipping a 90px tree beside a
 * 90px editor — the aside is itself draggable, down to 280px, so this is an ordinary Tuesday and
 * not an edge case.
 *
 * The open-files strip stays on screen in every arrangement — a tab you cannot see is a buffer you
 * cannot get back to — and the back control it carries appears only where there IS a back: in the
 * split the tree is already on screen, so the control that answers "get it out of my way" is the
 * collapse toggle on the Studio's own bar, never a control that would empty the editor pane.
 *
 * SWITCHING TABS MAY NEVER DESTROY WHAT WAS TYPED, and that is the one rule this composition
 * exists to keep. `RepoFileEditor` re-reads its file on mount and disposes its Monaco model on
 * unmount, so a composition that mounted only the ACTIVE file would lose three lines of unsaved
 * work to an ordinary click on the tab beside it — a loss far more likely than the conflict the
 * editor's whole save machine is built around, in a feature whose headline promise is that nothing
 * is lost silently. So the editor is kept MOUNTED per open tab (`mountedEditors`), hidden rather
 * than unmounted, which is the cheapest correct answer of the three available: it preserves the
 * text, the dirty flag, the undo history, the scroll position and the cursor, and it needs no
 * change to the editor at all.
 *
 * THE SAME RULE HOLDS ONE LEVEL UP, and it was learned the hard way: the tree and the editor stack
 * are BOTH mounted, one of them hidden (`Layer`). Rendering one OR the other made "back to the
 * tree" — a control that promises to change nothing — destroy the very buffer the paragraph above
 * protects. Caught by running it, not by reading it.
 *
 * AND IT HOLDS A THIRD TIME, ONE LEVEL FURTHER OUT: LEAVING the Studio must not unmount it either.
 * `ArtifactsAside` keeps this component mounted and hidden behind the same `Layer` while the normal
 * aside is showing, so `onExit` is a control that changes what is on screen and nothing else. That
 * is why the exit is a plain callback and never an unmount.
 *
 * It is bounded rather than unbounded: the mounted set is the ACTIVE file plus every file with
 * UNSAVED changes. A clean background tab is unmounted, because re-reading it from the server
 * yields the same bytes and costs one request — there is nothing to lose. So the number of live
 * Monaco instances is "files you have actually edited and not saved", plus one.
 *
 * AUTOSAVE STAYS ON FOR A HIDDEN TAB, and the trade is stated rather than left to be discovered.
 * A background buffer that quietly stopped saving itself under an autosave switch the reader turned
 * ON is the same half-promise this feature refuses everywhere else; the cost is that a CONFLICT
 * raised on a hidden tab opens its question where nobody can see it. Nothing is lost by that — the
 * tab keeps its unsaved dot, the buffer is intact, and the question is there, answerable, the moment
 * the tab is selected again.
 *
 * A LIVE-AGENT BADGE reuses the SAME `turns` feed the Live tab already polls — no new polling loop,
 * per the design spec. The general badge is "the session's most recent live events are still
 * pending"; the STRONGER, file-specific one additionally matches a WRITE among those pending events
 * against the file on screen. It reads `LiveEvent.text`, which is the path, and never `ref`, which
 * is the harness's `tool_use` id: the plan's own draft compared `ref` against the open path, and
 * that badge could never have lit.
 *
 * THE LEVELS ABOVE THIS ONE ASK TOO, and this component is what lets them. Everything above keeps
 * the Studio mounted through gestures INSIDE the panel; the PAGE is what unmounts it — closing the
 * panel, navigating to another session or another screen. So the dirty paths are REPORTED to
 * `lib/unsavedBuffers.ts`, and `SessionsPage`'s `UnsavedChangesGuard` holds each of those drops
 * behind the same question this component asks for one tab, raised for N. Without the report the
 * guard counts nothing and asks nothing, which is the silent loss it exists to prevent.
 *
 * The open files belong to ONE session, and selecting a different session still resets this panel —
 * the tree, the strip and every buffer with it; there is nowhere to keep them. What changed is that
 * the switch is a NAVIGATION, and the navigation is held and asked about before it happens. A
 * STATED LIMIT remains: a switch the router cannot hold (the browser's own Back/Forward, see
 * `lib/unsavedLeave.ts`) still resets without a question.

// --- the toolbar's own fit (owner, 2026-09-19, follow-up) -----------------------------------------

/**
 * WHICH OF THE TOOLBAR'S OPTIONAL ITEMS SURVIVE AT THIS WIDTH — the fix for a bug this very feature
 * introduced: with a file open, the tree column can narrow to `TREE_MIN` (150px), and this row's
 * trailing content (the BETA tag, the fixed trio) was pushed past the column's own edge and CLIPPED
 * by the tree pane's `overflow: hidden` — present in the DOM, invisible, unreachable by mouse. A
 * control the reader cannot click is the dead control this whole feature exists to remove, so a
 * clipped one is a bug in this change, not a pre-existing one to route around.
 *
 * THE RULE, STATED ONCE: **`PanelFixedControls` (full screen, minimize, gear) is NEVER negotiable.**
 * It is reserved first (`FIXED_TRIO_W`) and every other item on this row is added back only if
 * there is still room, most-important-first — the same "give up the least important cell first"
 * shape `fitColumns`/`fitKpis` already use for the TUI's own tables (`packages/tui/src/components/
 * Primitives.tsx`, `packages/tui/src/screens/Overview.tsx`), applied here to a row of BUTTONS
 * instead of a row of DATA. Nothing about this feature's own point (the fixed trio, present and
 * reachable on every open panel) is ever traded away for a search icon or a beta badge.
 *
 * EVERY DROPPABLE ITEM HAS A ROUTE THAT DOES NOT NEED THIS ROW, so dropping it loses convenience,
 * never capability:
 *  - Search — global `Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F` (`useStudioSearchRequest`) opens the exact same
 *    whole-tree content search view from anywhere, key or no key visible here.
 *  - New file / New folder — any row's own "⋯" menu (`RepoTreeView.tsx`'s `handleMenuAction`) offers
 *    both `new-file`/`new-folder`, created beside that row rather than at the root.
 *  - The working dot and the BETA badge are both purely informational (no `onClick`), so hiding them
 *    costs a reader nothing to click through — only something to read.
 *
 * ADDED BACK IN THIS ORDER (most useful first, so the first thing lost as the column narrows is the
 * least useful): the three tree actions, icon-only — Search, then New file, then New folder, since
 * losing all three at once would be the worst reading and Search is asked for most; the working dot;
 * the BETA badge, as its existing `compact` dot; labels on the tree actions, ALL AT ONCE — half the
 * row labelled and half not reads as broken, the same reasoning `PanelBar`'s own `compact` flag
 * already applies uniformly rather than per-tab; the BETA badge's full word, last, because a beta
 * caveat is worth a wider screen but never worth crowding the very controls being fixed here.
 *
 * `width <= 0` (not measured yet) reads as the WIDEST state, the same convention `useElementWidth`'s
 * own header documents for every other caller — a first frame that assumed narrow would flash
 * compact-then-wide on every mount instead of the other way around.
 *
 * THIS IS A STRICT PREFIX, NOT AN INDEPENDENT PER-ITEM CHECK — the first item on the priority list
 * that does not fit STOPS the whole list there, exactly the shape `fitKpis` already uses for its own
 * KPI row (`packages/tui/src/screens/Overview.tsx`) rather than skipping a large item to try a
 * smaller one behind it. That is not only fidelity to the existing convention: a "skip and keep
 * trying" reading is not MONOTONIC in width. A first version of this function tried every item
 * independently, and widening the toolbar by a single pixel could let a higher-priority item start
 * fitting, spend the room a LOWER-priority item was already sitting in, and make that one disappear
 * again — a control flickering in and out as a reader drags the tree wider. A strict prefix cannot:
 * widening the toolbar only ever EXTENDS how far down this list gets, never retracts it (pinned by
 * this file's own `studioToolbarFit — ... monotonic` test).
 *
 * THE COSTS BELOW ARE TAKEN FROM THE REAL RENDERED DOM, NOT GUESSED — and the first version of this
 * function guessed, which is exactly what let the bug this whole feature exists to fix reappear
 * inside its own repair. A live check at 390×844 (mobile) found the trio pushed to `x≈417` on a
 * 390px-wide screen — clipped by an ancestor and unreachable by touch, invisible in a screenshot,
 * exactly the defect item 1 describes, just reached through mobile's full-width row instead of
 * desktop's narrow tree column. The cause: the first version charged one flat, invented width for
 * "a labelled tree-action button" (46px) and one flat gap (6px) for every step alike. Measured off a
 * live `BarButton` (a detached clone, same font/padding/border, both languages): the labelled
 * buttons are 86–125px each — "Novo arquivo" alone is 124px, not 46 — and the row spends TWO
 * different gaps, not one: `Toolbar`'s own row (`gap: 6`) between Search/New file/New folder and the
 * trailing span, and a SEPARATE `gap: 8` inside that trailing span, between the working dot, the
 * BETA tag and `PanelFixedControls` itself. Charging every step the row's 6px hid that the working
 * dot and the BETA tag actually cost 8, and the flat 46px-per-button label estimate was less than a
 * third of what "New file"/"Novo arquivo" actually spends — so the function told the row it could
 * afford full labels at a width the row could not, and the trio was pushed off the end of a
 * container that clips instead of scrolling. Every constant below is now the MEASURED figure (the
 * wider of the English and Portuguese label, rounded up), so the function is wrong only in the safe
 * direction: it may give up an item the real row still had a pixel or two of room for, it must never
 * claim room the real row does not have. See `Studio.test.tsx`'s own
 * `studioToolbarFit — measured against the DOM` block for the values themselves, cross-checked
 * against a live clone of the exact buttons.
 *
 * `width` IS ALREADY NET OF THE ROW'S OWN PADDING — do not reserve it a second time. This is the
 * THIRD thing measurement caught, at the true `TREE_MIN` (150px) itself: a live probe (a debug attr
 * echoing the exact `toolbarWidth` this function receives) read `134`, not `150`, at a tree column
 * whose own `getBoundingClientRect().width` was genuinely `150`. `useElementWidth`'s ref callback
 * measures the FIRST frame with `getBoundingClientRect()` (border box, padding included) but every
 * frame after a resize with `ResizeObserver`'s `contentRect` (content box, padding already
 * subtracted) — the two disagree by exactly this row's own `16px` of horizontal padding, and every
 * width this function is ever asked about in practice has been through at least one resize by the
 * time a reader can act on it. Reserving `STUDIO_TOOLBAR_ROW_PADDING` on top of an already-padding-
 * exclusive number double-spent those 16px and hid `Search` outright at the real `TREE_MIN` — the
 * DOM had room for it (122 needed, 134 available) and the function claimed it did not (138 needed
 * against the same 134, since the padding was subtracted twice). There is nothing to reserve for the
 * row's padding here for exactly that reason: `useElementWidth` already spent it before this
 * function ever sees the number.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF STEP, not one — this is the second thing the first version got wrong.
 * A step that adds a NEW element (an icon-only tree action, the working dot, the compact BETA dot)
 * pays its own gap on top of its own width — that gap did not exist on the row before it. A step
 * that only WIDENS an element already on the row (labels appearing on the three tree actions, the
 * BETA tag growing from its dot to the word) pays no gap at all — nothing new joined the row, an
 * existing flex item simply grew. Charging every step a gap, as the first version did, overcounted
 * the two upgrade steps and undercounted nothing, which is a safe direction to be wrong in — it is
 * fixed here anyway because it produced a wrong THRESHOLD the labels test below had to special-case.

 * THE GEAR MENU'S OWN ROWS, AS DATA — what each one SAYS, given the state it is offered in.
 *
 * Split out from the JSX that wires an icon and an `onSelect` to each row so the LABELS — the part
 * a reader actually reads, and the part most likely to drift — are testable without a DOM: this
 * package has none, so a menu built only ever inline inside JSX would leave "does it say the RIGHT
 * thing" untested, the same gap `studioLayout`/`resolveTreeShown` already exist to close for the
 * panes themselves. Each label STATES its current value rather than a bare verb — "Ocultar árvore"
 * / "Mostrar árvore", "Mover árvore para a direita" / "…para a esquerda", "Tela cheia" / "Sair da
 * tela cheia" — because a menu a reader cannot glance at and tell apart from its own opposite is a
 * menu they have to open to find out, every time.
 *
 * ORDER is stable and deliberate: the tree's own two rows first — what this menu REPLACED
 * (`StudioBar`'s former "Ocultar árvore"/"Árvore à direita") stay adjacent to each other, exactly
 * as they were two separate buttons side by side — MOVE next (the panel's own placement, from the
 * ONE shared builder, `lib/panelMenu.ts`), close LAST (the one row whose effect is leaving the
 * panel). FULL SCREEN IS NO LONGER IN THIS LIST (2026-09-19) — it is `PanelFixedControls`' own
 * fixed button now, beside this very menu's trigger; see this file's own render for where it lives.
 *
 * THIS IS NOW THE ONE MENU THE STUDIO CARRIES WHEREVER IT IS (owner, 2026-09-19). It used to have
 * TWO: this one, and `StudioBand`'s own separate "Mais ações" when bottom-docked — two menus that
 * could (and did) disagree about what "move" meant the moment the Studio moved to the right, since
 * only THIS one travels with the component. `StudioBand`'s overflow is gone; its "close" row is
 * the shared builder's own `close` row, merged in here instead.
 *
 * MOVE IS GONE FROM HERE ON DESKTOP ONLY (addendum, 2026-09-21) — it now lives on the Studio's own
 * rail icon / bottom tab right-click menu (`PanelRail`/`PanelBar`'s shared `PanelContextMenu`, both
 * already built generically over every panel including this one), exactly once rather than in two
 * places that could drift the way this gear and `StudioBand`'s old one once did on desktop.
 * `panelMenuEntriesWithoutMove` is the filter that removes it there.
 *
 * ON MOBILE, MOVE STAYS (`mobile: true` keeps `panelMenuEntries`' full list) — spec §8 already
 * states the reason for every OTHER panel's gear ("drag, right-click and the rail's config area are
 * desktop-only; the gear menu covers those verbs there") and this menu is no exception, even though
 * it travels with the Studio rather than living in `rightSlotBar`/`SimpleDockedBand`. There is no
 * rail on a phone to right-click and no `contextmenu` gesture a touch reader can rely on, so
 * stripping move here unconditionally left NO way to move the Studio on mobile at all — reproduced
 * live at 390px: the gear opened with only "Fechar Studio", where "Mover Studio para a
 * direita/baixo" used to be.
 *
 * A row is ABSENT rather than present-and-refusing when it has nothing to act on: `treeCollapsible`
 * (the exact gate `StudioBar` used to read for both tree rows). "Close" has no gate: it is the one
 * row this menu always carries, the reason `onExit` stays a REQUIRED prop on `Studio` itself (see
 * this file's header on why an exit that can be absent is a reader trapped in a panel).

/**
 * ONE REGION, SEVERAL MOUNTED TREES, EXACTLY ONE OF THEM VISIBLE.
 *
 * **IT IS NESTED, AND `visibility` COULD NOT SURVIVE THAT.** This used to hide with
 * `visibility: hidden`, which is wrong here for a reason CSS states outright: `visibility` is
 * INHERITED AND OVERRIDABLE, so a descendant setting `visibility: visible` re-shows itself inside a
 * hidden ancestor. And a descendant always does — `Studio` renders two of these inside itself and
 * one of them is always `shown`, while `ArtifactsAside` now renders the whole Studio inside one
 * more. Reproduced in Chromium on exactly this nesting: the inner layer computed `visible` under an
 * ancestor computing `hidden`, `elementsFromPoint` returned it ABOVE the tab body, and a screenshot
 * showed the file tree painted over the tab the reader had switched to. Because the box is
 * `position: absolute; inset: 0` it covered the region completely; because `inert` IS inherited and
 * cannot be undone by a descendant, what you got was a frozen, unclickable panel over your content.
 *
 * So the hide is `opacity: 0`, which a descendant cannot reverse (it is not inherited — it composites
 * the whole subtree), plus `pointer-events: none` for the clicks `opacity` leaves live and `inert`
 * for the keyboard, the accessibility tree AND hit-testing — `inert`, not `pointer-events`, is what
 * makes the last of those a guarantee, because a descendant CAN set `pointer-events: auto` and
 * become the hit target again while an inherited `inert` cannot be lifted from inside. That puts a
 * browser-support floor under this component (`inert`: Safari 16.4, Chrome 102, Firefox 112), which
 * is stated on the style itself. **`display: none` is the one thing this component
 * exists to avoid**: a display-less box measures ZERO, and a zero-sized Monaco is the one state its
 * `automaticLayout` then has to recover from — which is why the layer has to keep measuring while it
 * is hidden.
 *
 * THE COST IS STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: `opacity: 0` keeps the subtree in the DOCUMENT's text,
 * which `visibility: hidden` would not — the browser's own find-in-page can still match a hidden
 * buffer. That is the cheaper half of the trade. `inert` is what keeps it out of the ACCESSIBILITY
 * tree and away from the keyboard, so a screen reader never reads it, and nothing here is ever the
 * only copy of anything on screen: the hidden layer is always a file the reader has open and can
 * bring back. Measured on a live session — the hidden layer computed `opacity: 0`,
 * `pointer-events: none` (inherited by its own shown children, which is exactly the point) and
 * `inert`, and `elementsFromPoint` over the middle of the region returned the visible content.
 *
 * `data-layer-shown` is the attribute the tests read; it is also the only honest way to ask this
 * question from outside, since every style here is inline.

/**
 * WHETHER A STACKED PANE'S OWN BOX MAY TAKE A TAP — the half of `Layer`'s rule that lives out here.
 *
 * `Layer` makes a hidden pane's CONTENT untouchable (`opacity: 0`, `pointer-events: none`, `inert`
 * over the whole subtree) and that was read as making the PANE untouchable. It does not. The box
 * the layer sits in is a different element, and in `layers` both boxes are `position: absolute;
 * inset: 0` over one region — an absolutely positioned div with no background of its own paints
 * nothing and is still a perfectly good hit target, and the EDITOR's box is the one that comes last
 * in the DOM. So on a phone every tap meant for the file tree landed on an invisible editor pane:
 * the tree was fully drawn, scrolled correctly, and did nothing at all — no file would open, and
 * neither would `Buscar` or `Novo`, which are inside it. The only control that still worked was the
 * bar above the region, i.e. the one that leaves.
 *
 * Measured at 390x844 against a live session before the fix — `document.elementsFromPoint` over the
 * middle of the `AGENTS.md` row answered, topmost first:
 *   DIV[data-studio-pane=editor] pe=auto op=1 inert=false pos=absolute box=0,45 390x799
 *   SPAN … BUTTON box=0,102 390x44   ← the row, underneath it
 * and Playwright refused the click with `<div data-studio-pane="editor"> intercepts pointer
 * events`. The desktop never saw it because `split` makes the two boxes flex SIBLINGS, which
 * overlap nothing; `layers` is the phone and the narrow aside.
 *
 * It is `pointer-events` and deliberately NOT `inert`. `inert` is INHERITED and cannot be lifted
 * from inside, so a box carrying it would freeze a `Layer` that became shown while the box had not
 * caught up — there is no style the layer could write to get out. `Layer`'s own comment calls
 * `pointer-events` the weak leg because a DESCENDANT may set `auto` and become the target again,
 * and that is exactly what makes it right here and wrong there: the box has no content of its own
 * to re-enable anything, and everything under it is already held by the layer's `inert`.
 *
 * Not restricted to `layers`, even though that is the arrangement that overlaps: a collapsed column
 * in the split is zero-wide and cannot be hit either way, so the narrower rule would buy nothing and
 * would have to be reasoned out again the next time a pane is positioned over another one.

/**
 * WHERE THE TWO PANES SIT — and nothing else.
 *
 * It takes the tree and the editor as NODES and decides only their boxes. That separation is the
 * whole point: every rule about what stays mounted and how a hidden pane is hidden lives in `Layer`
 * and in `mountedEditors`, one level in, and a layout that reached into either would be a second
 * place for the rules this panel exists to keep to be got wrong. Drop the split tomorrow and the
 * buffers are untouched.
 *
 * ONE DOM SHAPE FOR BOTH ARRANGEMENTS, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Rendering a
 * different tree per layout would REMOUNT everything under it the moment the aside was dragged past
 * `SPLIT_MIN` or a phone was turned sideways — which is `RepoFileEditor` re-reading its file and
 * disposing its Monaco model, i.e. exactly the silent loss of typed text this composition is
 * arranged to make impossible. So the panes are the same two boxes in both cases and only their
 * STYLES differ: absolutely stacked over one region when `layers`, side by side in a flex row when
 * `split`.
 *
 * THE COLLAPSE IS A WIDTH, NOT A `display`. The pane goes to zero and clips, while the SIZER inside
 * it keeps the tree laid out at its full width the whole time — so the tree's scroll position and
 * its wrapping survive being hidden, which reflowing it to zero would destroy, and `display: none`
 * would destroy along with everything `Layer`'s own comment says about measuring. The `Layer` is
 * told `shown={false}` for the same reasons it always is: `inert` is what takes a clipped-but-alive
 * column out of the keyboard's reach and out of the accessibility tree.
 *
 * The pane BOXES carry `data-studio-pane` and the region `data-studio-layout` — every style here is
 * inline, so those attributes are the only honest way to ask this question from outside.

/**
 * Every mounted buffer, stacked — exactly one of them visible.
 *
 * This is where "switching tabs does not destroy what you typed" is actually spent, so it is its own
 * exported component: a test can render it with two paths and see BOTH editors in the markup, which
 * is the one fact the pure `mountedEditors` cannot carry on its own.
 *
 * The editors are stacked absolutely inside one relative box so that every one of them has the full
 * region's size, visible or not — which is exactly what `Layer` is, so it is `Layer` that draws them
 * rather than a second copy of the same three styles. That matters beyond tidiness: this stack sits
 * INSIDE two more layers, and `Layer`'s doc comment records why the hide may not be `visibility`
 * (a descendant can set `visibility: visible` and re-show itself through a hidden ancestor, which
 * shipped once and painted a frozen file tree over the tab the reader had switched to). One hiding
 * rule, in one place, for every level of the nest.
 *
 * `data-editor-path` stays on a wrapper of its own: it is what the tests count mounted buffers by,
 * and `Layer` carries no identity.
 *
 * **`keys` IS WHAT LETS A RENAME SURVIVE.** The `React.key` here used to be `path` itself, which is
 * exactly right for every ORDINARY case — a path only ever changes by the host swapping in a
 * different file, which must remount — and exactly wrong for the one case that is not that: a
 * rename or a move changes an open tab's `path` while it stays the SAME logical file. Keying by
 * `path` there would unmount `RepoFileEditor` and remount a fresh one, which disposes the live
 * Monaco model and re-reads the new name from disk — the unsaved text and the undo stack the rename
 * was never meant to touch, gone. `keys[i]` is each path's STABLE identity (`OpenTab.id`, minted once
 * when the tab is opened and never the path itself — see `repoTreeModel.ts`'s own header for why a
 * path-derived id collided with a freshly created file reusing a renamed tab's old name), so a
 * renamed tab keeps the SAME React instance and only its `path` PROP changes; `RepoFileEditor` detects that on its own
 * (comparing the prop against the path it saw last render) and treats it as a retarget rather than
 * a new file — see its own header. `keys` is OPTIONAL and defaults to `path` itself, which is
 * today's exact behaviour, so every caller that never renames anything (every test below, and every
 * caller before this task) is unaffected.

 * scratch: a folder only appears here once it has already been read at least once, exactly the
 * condition `applyDirRefresh`'s own header states for refreshing it after the move — so every
 * destination this picker can offer is already a real node the move's own refresh can land on.
 *
 * **It is a COPY from that point on, not a shared reference (a review minor,
 * `session-w1c-tree-ops-review.md` — an earlier draft of this comment claimed otherwise).**
 * `liveTree` is this component's OWN state, re-seeded from `tree` only when the PROP changes;
 * expanding a folder here calls `toggleDirectory` against `liveTree`/`setLiveTree`, never against
 * the tree view's own `onTreeChange`, so a folder opened from inside this picker does NOT stay open
 * in the tree behind it once the picker closes. That is the right behaviour (a destination browsed
 * while choosing where to move something is not a request to change what the tree itself has
 * expanded) — the earlier comment simply described the wrong mechanism for it.
 *
 * Illegal targets are not merely refused on click — they are ABSENT from the list, the same rule
 * this product applies to a control that cannot act at all (`ControlService.startOptions`'s own
 * "the offer is unreachable rather than refused after the fact"): a folder that is the item itself,
 * one of its own descendants, or the folder the item is already in, offers nothing a click here

        THE WAY BETWEEN THE TWO LAYERS, AND ON A PHONE IT IS THE ONLY ONE — so it carries a WORD.
        `layers` is the whole arrangement at 390px: the tree and the editor are not two columns you
        glance between, they are two screens, and this is the single control that goes from the
        second back to the first. It was an `IconButton` on both layouts — a bare 15px arrow in a
        strip of filenames, with its name reachable only through `title`, which a phone has no hover
        to show. MEASURED at 390x844 on a live session: painted 22x22, and `.ag-tap-icon`'s invisible
        box brought the real hit area to 34x35, not the 44 the class's own doc claims for it.
        Two things were wrong at once and the label is the one that mattered more: a reader who
        cannot see what a control does does not press it to find out.

        Height only, never a 44x44 square — the label is what makes it wide enough for a finger, and
        a painted square around a labelled control is what `touchTarget.lint.test.ts` refuses. On the
        DESKTOP this appears only in the narrow aside, where the strip is a few pixels tall and the
        reader has a pointer and a tooltip, so it keeps the icon it had.
