/**
 * Studio — Agentistics Studio's own root: the tree, the search and a multi-tab Monaco editor, as
 * LAYERS over one panel rather than a split.
 *
 * IT IS A MODE, NOT A TAB, and that is the one thing to understand before changing anything here.
 * It began as one tab among the aside's fourteen, under the aside's own "Contents" header and its
 * tab strip — two rows of chrome above a file tree and a code editor, in a column 440px wide. A
 * tree plus an editor cannot share vertical space with that, so opening the Studio now REPLACES the
 * aside's chrome: `ArtifactsAside` renders this component as a `Layer` at its own root, over the
 * header and the strip, at the full size of the aside. The way back is this component's OWN top
 * edge (`onExit`), which is the only chrome there is here — and it is a required prop rather than an
 * optional one, because an exit that can be forgotten is a reader trapped in a panel.
 *
 * The name is the PRODUCT's, deliberately: Agentistics Studio, the studio of this product. It is
 * not "agent studio", which reads as a studio for building agents and is a different thing. The
 * modules under it keep their repository names (`repoApi`, `repoTreeModel`, `RepoTreeView`,
 * `RepoFileEditor`, …): those describe what they read, which really is a repository.
 *
 * THE TREE STAYS BESIDE THE EDITOR, and that is what `StudioBody` is for. Opening a file used to
 * REPLACE the tree with the editor, so reading one file and looking for the next were two modes you
 * moved between — asked about in those words: "quero tbm que quando um arquivo for aberto tenhamos
 * uma barra aqui redimensionavel e minimizavel que ainda mostra a arvore de arquivos pra eu poder
 * continuar navegando e explorando eles". So a file open on a wide enough panel puts the tree in a
 * column of its own on the left, DRAGGABLE and collapsible, with the editor beside it.
 *
 * IT IS A LAYOUT, NOT A SECOND COMPOSITION. Both panes are the same two `Layer`s that were stacked
 * before; `studioLayout` decides only whether they sit side by side or on top of each other, and
 * every rule below — what stays mounted, what hides and how — is untouched by that choice. A split
 * that built its own panes would be a second place for the mounting rules to be got wrong.
 *
 * `layers` IS STILL THE ANSWER IN TWO CASES, and neither is a fallback for the other. A PHONE has
 * one column: a tree and an editor sharing 390px is two things doing neither job, so there the
 * panes stay stacked and the open-files strip is what moves between them. And a panel too NARROW to
 * hold both minima (`SPLIT_MIN`) degrades the same way rather than shipping a 90px tree beside a
 * 90px editor — the aside is itself draggable, down to 280px, so this is an ordinary Tuesday and
 * not an edge case.
 *
 * The open-files strip stays on screen in every arrangement — a tab you cannot see is a buffer you
 * cannot get back to — and the back control it carries appears only where there IS a back: in the
 * split the tree is already on screen, so the control that answers "get it out of my way" is the
 * collapse toggle on the Studio's own bar, never a control that would empty the editor pane.
 *
 * SWITCHING TABS MAY NEVER DESTROY WHAT WAS TYPED, and that is the one rule this composition
 * exists to keep. `RepoFileEditor` re-reads its file on mount and disposes its Monaco model on
 * unmount, so a composition that mounted only the ACTIVE file would lose three lines of unsaved
 * work to an ordinary click on the tab beside it — a loss far more likely than the conflict the
 * editor's whole save machine is built around, in a feature whose headline promise is that nothing
 * is lost silently. So the editor is kept MOUNTED per open tab (`mountedEditors`), hidden rather
 * than unmounted, which is the cheapest correct answer of the three available: it preserves the
 * text, the dirty flag, the undo history, the scroll position and the cursor, and it needs no
 * change to the editor at all.
 *
 * THE SAME RULE HOLDS ONE LEVEL UP, and it was learned the hard way: the tree and the editor stack
 * are BOTH mounted, one of them hidden (`Layer`). Rendering one OR the other made "back to the
 * tree" — a control that promises to change nothing — destroy the very buffer the paragraph above
 * protects. Caught by running it, not by reading it.
 *
 * AND IT HOLDS A THIRD TIME, ONE LEVEL FURTHER OUT: LEAVING the Studio must not unmount it either.
 * `ArtifactsAside` keeps this component mounted and hidden behind the same `Layer` while the normal
 * aside is showing, so `onExit` is a control that changes what is on screen and nothing else. That
 * is why the exit is a plain callback and never an unmount.
 *
 * It is bounded rather than unbounded: the mounted set is the ACTIVE file plus every file with
 * UNSAVED changes. A clean background tab is unmounted, because re-reading it from the server
 * yields the same bytes and costs one request — there is nothing to lose. So the number of live
 * Monaco instances is "files you have actually edited and not saved", plus one.
 *
 * AUTOSAVE STAYS ON FOR A HIDDEN TAB, and the trade is stated rather than left to be discovered.
 * A background buffer that quietly stopped saving itself under an autosave switch the reader turned
 * ON is the same half-promise this feature refuses everywhere else; the cost is that a CONFLICT
 * raised on a hidden tab opens its question where nobody can see it. Nothing is lost by that — the
 * tab keeps its unsaved dot, the buffer is intact, and the question is there, answerable, the moment
 * the tab is selected again.
 *
 * A LIVE-AGENT BADGE reuses the SAME `turns` feed the Live tab already polls — no new polling loop,
 * per the design spec. The general badge is "the session's most recent live events are still
 * pending"; the STRONGER, file-specific one additionally matches a WRITE among those pending events
 * against the file on screen. It reads `LiveEvent.text`, which is the path, and never `ref`, which
 * is the harness's `tool_use` id: the plan's own draft compared `ref` against the open path, and
 * that badge could never have lit.
 *
 * THE LEVELS ABOVE THIS ONE ASK TOO, and this component is what lets them. Everything above keeps
 * the Studio mounted through gestures INSIDE the panel; the PAGE is what unmounts it — closing the
 * panel, navigating to another session or another screen. So the dirty paths are REPORTED to
 * `lib/unsavedBuffers.ts`, and `SessionsPage`'s `UnsavedChangesGuard` holds each of those drops
 * behind the same question this component asks for one tab, raised for N. Without the report the
 * guard counts nothing and asks nothing, which is the silent loss it exists to prevent.
 *
 * The open files belong to ONE session, and selecting a different session still resets this panel —
 * the tree, the strip and every buffer with it; there is nowhere to keep them. What changed is that
 * the switch is a NAVIGATION, and the navigation is held and asked about before it happens. A
 * STATED LIMIT remains: a switch the router cannot hold (the browser's own Back/Forward, see
 * `lib/unsavedLeave.ts`) still resets without a question.

/**
 * THE STUDIO'S OWN TOP EDGE — and the only chrome it has.
 *
 * The Studio covers the aside's header and its tab strip (see the file header), so the way out has
 * to be here.
 *
 * IT IS A CLOSE, NEVER A LINK NAMED AFTER ANOTHER PANEL — and that is a fix, not the original
 * design. This used to read "‹ Conteúdo": today the Studio is a MODE of `ArtifactsAside` and `onExit`
 * puts that panel's own chrome back, so the button named the destination it happened to land on. But
 * the design this component is built toward (see
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-studio-slots-and-references-design.md` §1) makes the Studio a
 * PANEL of its own, openable without the Contents tab ever having been open at all — a control that
 * always says "Conteúdo" would be lying on that path from the day it ships. `X` plus "Fechar
 * Studio"/"Close Studio" says only what is true in both worlds: this closes the Studio. `onExit`
 * itself is unchanged — see its own doc for why it may never unmount this component.
 *
 * ONE ROW, and as short as a row can be: the whole reason this surface took the aside over is
 * vertical space. It earns its height by being the exit and by saying what this is — the product
 * name in full, with the beta caveat the nav entries already carry, so the mark is on every surface
 * that names the feature rather than on some of them.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO WHERE THE TREE IS MINIMIZED AND BROUGHT BACK, and that is a placement decision. A rail
 * down the side of the collapsed column would have cost horizontal space permanently, in the one
 * direction this panel has none to give; this row is already on screen in every arrangement, and a
 * control whose whole job is to give the reader their width back should not itself take any. The
 * toggle is ABSENT outside the split — there is no second pane to hide there, and a button that
 * does nothing is worse than no button.

/**
 * ONE REGION, SEVERAL MOUNTED TREES, EXACTLY ONE OF THEM VISIBLE.
 *
 * **IT IS NESTED, AND `visibility` COULD NOT SURVIVE THAT.** This used to hide with
 * `visibility: hidden`, which is wrong here for a reason CSS states outright: `visibility` is
 * INHERITED AND OVERRIDABLE, so a descendant setting `visibility: visible` re-shows itself inside a
 * hidden ancestor. And a descendant always does — `Studio` renders two of these inside itself and
 * one of them is always `shown`, while `ArtifactsAside` now renders the whole Studio inside one
 * more. Reproduced in Chromium on exactly this nesting: the inner layer computed `visible` under an
 * ancestor computing `hidden`, `elementsFromPoint` returned it ABOVE the tab body, and a screenshot
 * showed the file tree painted over the tab the reader had switched to. Because the box is
 * `position: absolute; inset: 0` it covered the region completely; because `inert` IS inherited and
 * cannot be undone by a descendant, what you got was a frozen, unclickable panel over your content.
 *
 * So the hide is `opacity: 0`, which a descendant cannot reverse (it is not inherited — it composites
 * the whole subtree), plus `pointer-events: none` for the clicks `opacity` leaves live and `inert`
 * for the keyboard, the accessibility tree AND hit-testing — `inert`, not `pointer-events`, is what
 * makes the last of those a guarantee, because a descendant CAN set `pointer-events: auto` and
 * become the hit target again while an inherited `inert` cannot be lifted from inside. That puts a
 * browser-support floor under this component (`inert`: Safari 16.4, Chrome 102, Firefox 112), which
 * is stated on the style itself. **`display: none` is the one thing this component
 * exists to avoid**: a display-less box measures ZERO, and a zero-sized Monaco is the one state its
 * `automaticLayout` then has to recover from — which is why the layer has to keep measuring while it
 * is hidden.
 *
 * THE COST IS STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: `opacity: 0` keeps the subtree in the DOCUMENT's text,
 * which `visibility: hidden` would not — the browser's own find-in-page can still match a hidden
 * buffer. That is the cheaper half of the trade. `inert` is what keeps it out of the ACCESSIBILITY
 * tree and away from the keyboard, so a screen reader never reads it, and nothing here is ever the
 * only copy of anything on screen: the hidden layer is always a file the reader has open and can
 * bring back. Measured on a live session — the hidden layer computed `opacity: 0`,
 * `pointer-events: none` (inherited by its own shown children, which is exactly the point) and
 * `inert`, and `elementsFromPoint` over the middle of the region returned the visible content.
 *
 * `data-layer-shown` is the attribute the tests read; it is also the only honest way to ask this
 * question from outside, since every style here is inline.

/**
 * WHETHER A STACKED PANE'S OWN BOX MAY TAKE A TAP — the half of `Layer`'s rule that lives out here.
 *
 * `Layer` makes a hidden pane's CONTENT untouchable (`opacity: 0`, `pointer-events: none`, `inert`
 * over the whole subtree) and that was read as making the PANE untouchable. It does not. The box
 * the layer sits in is a different element, and in `layers` both boxes are `position: absolute;
 * inset: 0` over one region — an absolutely positioned div with no background of its own paints
 * nothing and is still a perfectly good hit target, and the EDITOR's box is the one that comes last
 * in the DOM. So on a phone every tap meant for the file tree landed on an invisible editor pane:
 * the tree was fully drawn, scrolled correctly, and did nothing at all — no file would open, and
 * neither would `Buscar` or `Novo`, which are inside it. The only control that still worked was the
 * bar above the region, i.e. the one that leaves.
 *
 * Measured at 390x844 against a live session before the fix — `document.elementsFromPoint` over the
 * middle of the `AGENTS.md` row answered, topmost first:
 *   DIV[data-studio-pane=editor] pe=auto op=1 inert=false pos=absolute box=0,45 390x799
 *   SPAN … BUTTON box=0,102 390x44   ← the row, underneath it
 * and Playwright refused the click with `<div data-studio-pane="editor"> intercepts pointer
 * events`. The desktop never saw it because `split` makes the two boxes flex SIBLINGS, which
 * overlap nothing; `layers` is the phone and the narrow aside.
 *
 * It is `pointer-events` and deliberately NOT `inert`. `inert` is INHERITED and cannot be lifted
 * from inside, so a box carrying it would freeze a `Layer` that became shown while the box had not
 * caught up — there is no style the layer could write to get out. `Layer`'s own comment calls
 * `pointer-events` the weak leg because a DESCENDANT may set `auto` and become the target again,
 * and that is exactly what makes it right here and wrong there: the box has no content of its own
 * to re-enable anything, and everything under it is already held by the layer's `inert`.
 *
 * Not restricted to `layers`, even though that is the arrangement that overlaps: a collapsed column
 * in the split is zero-wide and cannot be hit either way, so the narrower rule would buy nothing and
 * would have to be reasoned out again the next time a pane is positioned over another one.

/**
 * WHERE THE TWO PANES SIT — and nothing else.
 *
 * It takes the tree and the editor as NODES and decides only their boxes. That separation is the
 * whole point: every rule about what stays mounted and how a hidden pane is hidden lives in `Layer`
 * and in `mountedEditors`, one level in, and a layout that reached into either would be a second
 * place for the rules this panel exists to keep to be got wrong. Drop the split tomorrow and the
 * buffers are untouched.
 *
 * ONE DOM SHAPE FOR BOTH ARRANGEMENTS, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Rendering a
 * different tree per layout would REMOUNT everything under it the moment the aside was dragged past
 * `SPLIT_MIN` or a phone was turned sideways — which is `RepoFileEditor` re-reading its file and
 * disposing its Monaco model, i.e. exactly the silent loss of typed text this composition is
 * arranged to make impossible. So the panes are the same two boxes in both cases and only their
 * STYLES differ: absolutely stacked over one region when `layers`, side by side in a flex row when
 * `split`.
 *
 * THE COLLAPSE IS A WIDTH, NOT A `display`. The pane goes to zero and clips, while the SIZER inside
 * it keeps the tree laid out at its full width the whole time — so the tree's scroll position and
 * its wrapping survive being hidden, which reflowing it to zero would destroy, and `display: none`
 * would destroy along with everything `Layer`'s own comment says about measuring. The `Layer` is
 * told `shown={false}` for the same reasons it always is: `inert` is what takes a clipped-but-alive
 * column out of the keyboard's reach and out of the accessibility tree.

/**
 * Every mounted buffer, stacked — exactly one of them visible.
 *
 * This is where "switching tabs does not destroy what you typed" is actually spent, so it is its own
 * exported component: a test can render it with two paths and see BOTH editors in the markup, which
 * is the one fact the pure `mountedEditors` cannot carry on its own.
 *
 * The editors are stacked absolutely inside one relative box so that every one of them has the full
 * region's size, visible or not — which is exactly what `Layer` is, so it is `Layer` that draws them
 * rather than a second copy of the same three styles. That matters beyond tidiness: this stack sits
 * INSIDE two more layers, and `Layer`'s doc comment records why the hide may not be `visibility`
 * (a descendant can set `visibility: visible` and re-show itself through a hidden ancestor, which
 * shipped once and painted a frozen file tree over the tab the reader had switched to). One hiding
 * rule, in one place, for every level of the nest.
 *
 * `data-editor-path` stays on a wrapper of its own: it is what the tests count mounted buffers by,
 * and `Layer` carries no identity.
 *
 * **`keys` IS WHAT LETS A RENAME SURVIVE.** The `React.key` here used to be `path` itself, which is
 * exactly right for every ORDINARY case — a path only ever changes by the host swapping in a
 * different file, which must remount — and exactly wrong for the one case that is not that: a
 * rename or a move changes an open tab's `path` while it stays the SAME logical file. Keying by
 * `path` there would unmount `RepoFileEditor` and remount a fresh one, which disposes the live
 * Monaco model and re-reads the new name from disk — the unsaved text and the undo stack the rename
 * was never meant to touch, gone. `keys[i]` is each path's STABLE identity (`OpenTab.id`, minted once
 * when the tab is opened and never the path itself — see `repoTreeModel.ts`'s own header for why a
 * path-derived id collided with a freshly created file reusing a renamed tab's old name), so a
 * renamed tab keeps the SAME React instance and only its `path` PROP changes; `RepoFileEditor` detects that on its own
 * (comparing the prop against the path it saw last render) and treats it as a retarget rather than
 * a new file — see its own header. `keys` is OPTIONAL and defaults to `path` itself, which is
 * today's exact behaviour, so every caller that never renames anything (every test below, and every
 * caller before this task) is unaffected.

 * while choosing where to move something is not a request to change what the tree itself has
 * expanded) — the earlier comment simply described the wrong mechanism for it.
 *
 * Illegal targets are not merely refused on click — they are ABSENT from the list, the same rule
 * this product applies to a control that cannot act at all (`ControlService.startOptions`'s own
 * "the offer is unreachable rather than refused after the fact"): a folder that is the item itself,
 * one of its own descendants, or the folder the item is already in, offers nothing a click here
 * could do.

        THE WAY BETWEEN THE TWO LAYERS, AND ON A PHONE IT IS THE ONLY ONE — so it carries a WORD.
        `layers` is the whole arrangement at 390px: the tree and the editor are not two columns you
        glance between, they are two screens, and this is the single control that goes from the
        second back to the first. It was an `IconButton` on both layouts — a bare 15px arrow in a
        strip of filenames, with its name reachable only through `title`, which a phone has no hover
        to show. MEASURED at 390x844 on a live session: painted 22x22, and `.ag-tap-icon`'s invisible
        box brought the real hit area to 34x35, not the 44 the class's own doc claims for it.
        Two things were wrong at once and the label is the one that mattered more: a reader who
        cannot see what a control does does not press it to find out.

        Height only, never a 44x44 square — the label is what makes it wide enough for a finger, and
        a painted square around a labelled control is what `touchTarget.lint.test.ts` refuses. On the
        DESKTOP this appears only in the narrow aside, where the strip is a few pixels tall and the
        reader has a pointer and a tooltip, so it keeps the icon it had.

/**
 * `IconButton`, PLUS a short visible word (design item 5 — the plain icon-only pair on the Studio
 * bar was reported as confusing, circled in a screenshot beside the aside's own move-to-bottom
 * icon). A SEPARATE component rather than a new option on `IconButton` itself: that one is used
 * throughout this file for rename/cancel/close/back controls where an icon alone is exactly right
 * (a small square button beside an input, or a back arrow with a title next to it already) — giving
 * every one of those a label as a side effect of this fix would widen controls nobody asked about.
 *
 * `label` is the FULL sentence (the tooltip, and what a screen reader announces); `visibleText` is
 * the short word actually painted next to the icon, so the button stays a compact bar item rather
 * than a full sentence wide.
