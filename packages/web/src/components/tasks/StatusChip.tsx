/**
 * StatusChip — the one way to set a status, in the same place on every surface.
 *
 * There used to be six: the detail rail's chip, the table's own status cell, a kanban drag, the
 * batch bar, and two standalone buttons (`Mark delivered` / `Mark abandoned`) that did what two of
 * the menu rows already did. Each was reasonable and together they meant a reader had to learn
 * where the control was on THIS screen before they could use it. Jira moved its status dropdown
 * once and moved it back after the complaints: position stability is worth more than another way in.
 *
 * So: one component, drawn at the same point on the row, on the card and at the top of the
 * delivery. The kanban keeps its drag — that is what a board is FOR, and it is a different gesture
 * rather than a second control. `blocked` still opens its reason dialog, because the server refuses
 * a `blocked` with nothing to say and every surface inherits that refusal.
 *
 * It is a thin specialisation of `ChipSelect` on purpose: the panel, the mobile sheet, the
 * keyboard handling and the 44px targets are already solved there, and a second implementation of
 * a dropdown is a second set of those decisions.
