/**
 * SubtaskSessions — the sessions filed under one subtask, wherever a subtask is drawn.
 *
 * **A subtask holds ANY NUMBER of sessions.** That is new — the cell it replaces was
 * `Subtask.sessionId`, ONE session written straight onto the subtask record, which could not
 * express the ordinary case (a piece of work picked up again the next morning is a second session
 * on the same subtask) and was a second place the link lived: the server's `task-attach.ts` decides
 * where a session is filed, and a field on the other record was a rule nothing enforced. So this
 * reads the SESSIONS and asks which subtask each names, never the other way round. (A session may
 * also be filed on the delivery directly, under no subtask at all — see `task-attach.ts` and
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-task-session-hierarchy-design.md §4.1; that branch is drawn
 * elsewhere, not by this component.)
 *
 * `Subtask.sessionId` still exists on records written before this and is deliberately NOT read
 * here. It is not evidence: `TaskSessionRow.subtaskId` is what every rollup, every filter and the
 * server's own invariant are written against, and rendering a second, unreconciled source beside it
 * would put a session in a subtask the delivery's own arithmetic does not have it in.
 *
 * It is a plain function rather than a component so the two tables that call it keep their cells
 * inline in their own `<td>` — same reason `restrictionMiniTable` is one.

   * caller passing one id and a caller passing several cost this component nothing to tell apart.
