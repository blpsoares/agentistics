/**
 * HarnessBadges — the harnesses a delivery's sessions ran on, as a bounded row of pills.
 *
 * One component instead of four near-identical inline renders (the main board table, a repo's
 * Tasks tab table and its mobile card, the kanban card, the central board table) is what
 * `TaskProgressBar` already does for the progress bar, and for the same reason: four copies of one
 * rule is four chances for it to read differently on each screen.
 *
 * The rule it fixes: a task's harnesses list was rendered in full, `flexWrap`-ped, with no cap —
 * every harness this product supports, every one a distinct pill, in a column that has to sit next
 * to five or six other columns. A task whose sessions spanned most harnesses turned the column into
 * a block of colour nobody could read at a glance ("acumula badges e fica ilegível"). `capList`
 * (`board.ts`) caps it, and the remainder becomes a single `+N` pill — truthful (it names the exact
 * count) rather than silently dropped, and its `title` still lists every hidden harness so nothing
 * is actually lost, only deferred to a hover.
