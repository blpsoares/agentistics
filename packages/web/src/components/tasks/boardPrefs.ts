/**
 * boardPrefs — what the board looked like when you left it.
 *
 * Opening a task is a NAVIGATION (`/tasks/:id`), so the list unmounts and every piece of arrangement
 * it held — which view, which columns, which groups, which of them were folded — is gone by the time
 * you press back. Re-deciding all of it on every return is the same defect as a filter that resets
 * itself: the arrangement is the user's, and a surface that forgets it teaches people not to arrange
 * anything.
 *
 * It lives in `localStorage` and NOT in `/api/preferences`, deliberately: this is a per-viewer,
 * per-browser convenience, and on a central `preferences.json` is shared by everyone signed in —
 * one person's folded groups would fold them for the whole team.
 *
 * Every read and write is guarded. A private window, cleared site data, or a browser set to block
 * storage makes the accessor itself THROW, and a board that will not render because it could not
 * remember which columns were shown is worse than one that opens on the defaults.
