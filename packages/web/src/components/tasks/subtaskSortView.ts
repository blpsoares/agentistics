 * subtaskSortView.ts — the web's half of subtask sorting: what the shared comparator

 *
 * The comparator sorts what it is given and reads no rollup; the numbers a subtask column shows are
 * resolved HERE, through the same helpers the cells use (`subtaskRollupOf`, `costCellFor`,
 * `tokensCellFor`), so a column is ordered by exactly the figure printed in it — never a second
 * reading of the same rollup that could disagree with the cell beside it.

 *  - `sessions` is the count of sessions filed on it. A subtask with none has a real zero there (it
 *    was asked and the answer is none), unlike cost, which is empty until a session exists.
 *  - A Copilot-credits cost has no dollar figure to compare against a dollar one, so it counts as
