/**
 * SessionsPage — the CENTRE of the sessions workspace.
 *
 * On DESKTOP the list is not here: it is the aside's body (`SessionsAside`), because in this
 * workspace the sidebar IS the list, the way the chat applications this is shaped after do it. So
 * the page has two states — nothing selected, which shows what the fleet is doing, and one session
 * selected, which shows that session as a conversation or as its terminal.
 *
 * On MOBILE there is no aside at all — `App.tsx` renders `SideNav` only above the breakpoint — so
 * the page carries both halves and shows ONE AT A TIME, which is the convention every other
 * full-screen surface here follows. Nothing selected is the list; a selection is the session, with
 * a way back. The same components either way: a phone-only list would be a second implementation of
 * the arrangement, and it would drift.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is fetch. `useFleet` is a shared, refcounted store: the aside and this page
 * read the same snapshot from the same poll, so a list and a detail pane can never disagree about
 * a session's state by one poll interval — which is a bug people report as flicker.

 * planted regression (`key: rightIsStudio ? 'right' : 'bottom',` slipped into the literal props
 * object at THIS call site) sailed through it untouched, and only `sessionsPage.lint.test.ts`'s
 * source-text scan caught it. A source scan is not nothing, but the brief for this fix was explicit
 * that it is not enough on its own.
 *
 * Extracting the call is what lets a test reach it: `studioHostMount.test.ts` imports this SAME
 * function — the one `SessionsPage` itself renders below — and inspects the real
 * `React.ReactElement` it returns, exactly as `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` already does for
 * `mountPanel` in isolation. Two changes make the regression class harder to reintroduce, not just
 * easier to catch:
 *  - the fields are picked EXPLICITLY rather than spread from `params` — a stray `key` added to the
 *    params object at the call site below is dropped here before it ever reaches `mountPanel` /
 *    `createElement`, so that half of the old gap is closed by construction, not merely detected;
 *  - a `key` added directly to the object literal INSIDE this function (the equivalent regression,
 *    moved one level in) is exactly what `studioHostMount.test.ts` calls this function to catch.
 *
 * **Neither of those made a stray `key` on the object literal AT THE CALL SITE below fail anything
 * by itself** (fix wave 3's re-review finding) — this function's explicit field-picking absorbs it
 * silently at runtime, so the only things that could ever notice were the source scan below
 * (`sessionsPage.lint.test.ts`, and only for a `key` inside the LITERAL, not one routed through a
 * variable) and a human reading the diff. `StudioHostMountParams.key: never` (its own doc comment,
 * above) is what makes the call site itself fail to type-check for every shape measured, including

   * fixed trio (full screen, minimize, gear) every panel now carries, in the SAME order, through the
   * SAME shared builder (`lib/panelMenu.ts`) `ShellBand`'s own bar and the new bottom bands use, so

   * The STUDIO is deliberately absent from this list: it already carries this exact trio — its own
   * gear (move + tree options + close), its own minimize icon, and now its own fixed full-screen
   * button — inside its OWN toolbar, because that toolbar is what stays visible across the
   * tree/search/editor views this generic bar would otherwise sit above. Adding a second one here
   * would be two bars for one panel.
   *
   * FULL SCREEN (2026-09-19) is `fullscreenModeFor(panel)`-dependent: `cli`/`shell` NAVIGATE to
   * their existing dedicated screen (never a toggle — there is nothing to read back as "active"
   * from here), `contents`/`hardware` toggle the local in-place overlay this page now owns for them.
   *
   * Minimizing here is a genuine CLOSE (`panelMenu.ts`'s own `panelMinimizeAction` — `close-right`),
   * which is SAFE for exactly these four: none holds client-only state a remount could lose (see
   * that function's own header). The outcome a reader sees is identical to a soft minimize either
   * way — released from view, restored with one click on the panel bar's own tab.

  // ONE PANE, POSITIONED BY THE LAYOUT — never one pane per layout.
  //
  // `artifactsPane` used to be written into FOUR separate `return`s, one per `ArtifactLayout`, and
  // React reconciles by POSITION: four positions are four different elements, so crossing a
  // breakpoint unmounted the whole aside and mounted a new one. That is not a flicker. The Studio's
  // entire composition — `Layer`, `mountedEditors`, `StudioBody`'s one DOM shape — exists to make
  // sure an unsaved buffer survives every move a reader can make inside it, and the surface holding
  // it was throwing the lot away the moment the WINDOW changed size. On a phone the window changes
  // size when you turn it over, or when the keyboard opens.
  //
  // Measured at 390x844 on a live session, before this: two files open in the Studio, the second
  // one edited and the strip reading `artifactLayout.test.ts — não salvo`, 1 Monaco instance. One
  // resize to 1600x900 and the same reads gave `openTabs: []`, `monaco: 0`, and a re-fetched tree.
  // The typed text was gone, with nothing on screen having said so.
  //
  // So the pane is ONE element in ONE slot and the LAYOUT is a style. Everything that differed
  // between the four branches — fixed over the phone, absolute over the conversation, a column in a
  // flex row — is `artOuter`/`artInner` below, and every other slot in this return is always
  // present (`null` when it draws nothing) so no sibling can shift the pane's index either.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated rather than discovered: the CENTRE still changes shape across
  // 768px (a phone has a back bar and a title; a desktop has the edge strip), so `SessionPanel`
  // remounts on that crossing exactly as it always has. The conversation is re-read from the
  // server and a half-typed prompt is held by `composerStore`, so nothing is lost there — which is
  // precisely what was NOT true of the Studio, whose buffers live nowhere but in its own DOM. (So a
  // drop that is not a layout change — the panel closing, the page navigating — is ASKED about
  // first; see `leaveGuard`.)

   *
   * Re-measured on every cause the edge can move: the aside's OWN box changing size (the drag
   * handle above, or the `split` shell's own width transition — `ResizeObserver` on `artOuter`
   * itself) and the ROOM around it changing without the aside's own box changing size at all (a
   * sidebar drag or a window resize shrinks `splitRef`, which shifts an `overlay` aside's `right: 0`
   * position with no size change of its own — `ResizeObserver` would miss that, `splitRoom` catches
   * it, because it is already recomputed for exactly that set of causes; see `panelWidth`, above).
   *
   * **The `overlay` shell (below `SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH`) opens on `transform` alone — `width` never
   * changes — so `ResizeObserver` never fires for it at all**, reported by review as a Critical: the
   * one synchronous `report()` this effect used to make was also the LAST one, taken while the aside
   * still sat translated off-screen (its mount-time `translateX(100%)`), and nothing corrected it
   * until an unrelated cause re-ran the effect — the Filtros panel then measured "plenty of room"
   * against a box that had since visually slid into view, reproducing the original occlusion on an
   * ordinary first open. Two changes close it: `report()` reads `restingLeftEdge`, which discounts
   * the box's own `translateX` and so answers with the SETTLED position regardless of where the
   * slide currently sits (correct even at that very first off-screen frame); and the effect also
   * re-measures on the box's own `transitionend`/`transitioncancel` (filtered to the `transform`
   * property, so an unrelated child transition cannot trigger it) and whenever `asideIn` itself
   * flips, as a second line of defense for whatever `restingLeftEdge` cannot see.
   *
   * `getBoundingClientRect()`, not the observer's own `contentRect` — that rect is relative to the

                 strip (`App.tsx`), which this layout does not render — the actions live in this
                 menu instead, which is where the panel's own entry already is. A tile in the
                 bottom nav's "More" sheet was the other candidate and is wrong: that sheet is
                 machine-wide chrome and the Studio is about the SESSION you have open, which
                 only this menu has.
                 ABSENT when the gate is closed, never greyed — the same `editorEnabled` the
                 aside reads, the server's own already-resolved answer with a CENTRAL already
                 subtracted where the app publishes it (`lib/editorGate.ts`): the `/api/fleet`
                 prefix is refused on a central, and this row used to be the one entry that
                 offered the Studio there.
                 NO `badge` ANY MORE (see §2 of the slots/references design): the desktop button
                 dropped its `NewTag` for a dot that clears after the first open, and a row with
                 no icon corner to put a dot on just drops the mark rather than keeping a word the
                 other nav lost. The beta caveat stays on the Studio's own top bar, one tap away.
                 `on: isPanelShown(slotLayout, 'studio')` mirrors the desktop button's pressed
                 state — the same `panelSlots.ts` layout, so a reader who opened the Studio from
                 THIS row and then came back to the menu finds it marked current. Built by
                 `studioMenuRow` (above `SessionsPage`) rather than as a literal here, so its `on`
                 wiring is asserted directly — see `SessionsPage.test.tsx`. */

          Mounted only once the reader has actually opened it (`isPanelShown`), and only while the
          gate is open — the same two conditions `ArtifactsAside`'s own Studio mount used to read
          before this feature moved the Studio out of it.

          MOUNTED THROUGH `mountStudioHostPanel` (module-level, above), not a hand-written
          `cond && (<StudioHost .../>)`: a move (right↔bottom) changes `target` below without
          changing WHETHER this is shown, and `mountPanel` (`lib/panelSlots.ts`) inside that function
          is what makes "no `key=` of its own, exactly one call site" a fact about a function every
          caller shares rather than a rule this page has to keep re-observing. `sessionsPage.lint.
          test.ts`'s own I4 block pins this call SITE's literal (a `key` at ANY field position fails
          it — fix wave 3 restored the whole-literal scan a prior fix wave had narrowed to an
          occurrence count), `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` pins `mountPanel` itself, and
          `studioHostMount.test.ts` (I4) calls `mountStudioHostPanel` DIRECTLY and inspects the real
          `React.ReactElement` it returns. **None of those three is what makes a stray `key` on the
          object literal below impossible to compile** — a source scan and a call through the real
          function both stay green for a `key` reached only via an intermediate typed variable, which
          neither one ever executes or reads. `StudioHostMountParams.key: never` (its own doc comment)
          is the one guarantee that closes that: it fails `tsc` for the literal below AND for that
