/**
 * SessionsPage — the CENTRE of the sessions workspace.
 *
 * On DESKTOP the list is not here: it is the aside's body (`SessionsAside`), because in this
 * workspace the sidebar IS the list, the way the chat applications this is shaped after do it. So
 * the page has two states — nothing selected, which shows what the fleet is doing, and one session
 * selected, which shows that session as a conversation or as its terminal.
 *
 * On MOBILE there is no aside at all — `App.tsx` renders `SideNav` only above the breakpoint — so
 * the page carries both halves and shows ONE AT A TIME, which is the convention every other
 * full-screen surface here follows. Nothing selected is the list; a selection is the session, with
 * a way back. The same components either way: a phone-only list would be a second implementation of
 * the arrangement, and it would drift.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is fetch. `useFleet` is a shared, refcounted store: the aside and this page
 * read the same snapshot from the same poll, so a list and a detail pane can never disagree about
 * a session's state by one poll interval — which is a bug people report as flicker.

 * planted regression (`key: rightIsStudio ? 'right' : 'bottom',` slipped into the literal props
 * object at THIS call site) sailed through it untouched, and only `sessionsPage.lint.test.ts`'s
 * source-text scan caught it. A source scan is not nothing, but the brief for this fix was explicit
 * that it is not enough on its own.
 *
 * Extracting the call is what lets a test reach it: `studioHostMount.test.ts` imports this SAME
 * function — the one `SessionsPage` itself renders below — and inspects the real
 * `React.ReactElement` it returns, exactly as `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` already does for
 * `mountPanel` in isolation. Two changes make the regression class harder to reintroduce, not just
 * easier to catch:
 *  - the fields are picked EXPLICITLY rather than spread from `params` — a stray `key` added to the
 *    params object at the call site below is dropped here before it ever reaches `mountPanel` /
 *    `createElement`, so that half of the old gap is closed by construction, not merely detected;
 *  - a `key` added directly to the object literal INSIDE this function (the equivalent regression,
 *    moved one level in) is exactly what `studioHostMount.test.ts` calls this function to catch.
 *
 * **Neither of those made a stray `key` on the object literal AT THE CALL SITE below fail anything
 * by itself** (fix wave 3's re-review finding) — this function's explicit field-picking absorbs it
 * silently at runtime, so the only things that could ever notice were the source scan below
 * (`sessionsPage.lint.test.ts`, and only for a `key` inside the LITERAL, not one routed through a
 * variable) and a human reading the diff. `StudioHostMountParams.key: never` (its own doc comment,
 * above) is what makes the call site itself fail to type-check for every shape measured, including

   * THE PANEL'S OWN FULL-SCREEN/MINIMIZE/GEAR TRIO — the SAME `PanelFixedControls` cluster every

   * (`lib/panelMenu.ts`), so this can never disagree with what `ShellBand`'s own bar or a bottom
   * band says about an identical gesture.
   *
   * MOVED AHEAD OF `tabPane` (fix-wave review, item 5: "every panel drawn in the right slot has ONE
   * header row — the panel's own title and its counts on the left, the controls right-aligned in
   * that same row. No separate strip above it. Do it once, in the shared chrome that wraps a
   * right-slot panel"). This trio used to be built INSIDE `rightSlotBar`, a separate strip drawn
   * ABOVE whatever the panel itself rendered — for `cli`/`shell` (which draw no header of their
   * own) that cost nothing, but Hardware and the ten former Contents tabs each ALSO draw their own
   * title row, so the two together were a mostly-empty controls-only strip sitting on top of a
   * second, real header — exactly the "empty header" the owner's Hardware/Skills screenshots show.
   * Pulled out here as its own function, this trio is now handed to those two as a PROP
   * (`HardwarePanelProps.controls`, `ArtifactsAsideProps.headerControls`) and merged into the ONE
   * header row they already draw, and `rightSlotBar` (further down, where `cli`/`shell` still need
   * a wrapper row of their own) is left as a thin caller of this same function — one builder, never
   * two answers about what the trio looks like.
   *
   * The STUDIO is deliberately absent from every caller of this: it already carries this exact trio
   * — its own gear (tree options + close), its own minimize icon, and its own fixed full-screen
   * button — inside its OWN toolbar (`Studio.tsx`), because that toolbar is what stays visible
   * across the tree/search/editor views a generic header row would otherwise sit above. Calling this
   * for Studio too would be two bars for one panel.
   *
   * FULL SCREEN (2026-09-19) is `fullscreenModeFor(panel)`-dependent: `cli`/`shell` NAVIGATE to
   * their existing dedicated screen (never a toggle — there is nothing to read back as "active"
   * from here), `contents`/`hardware` toggle the local in-place overlay this page now owns for them.
   *
   * Minimizing here is a genuine CLOSE (`panelMenu.ts`'s own `panelMinimizeAction` — `close-right`),
   * which is SAFE for exactly these four: none holds client-only state a remount could lose. The
   * outcome a reader sees is identical to a soft minimize either way — released from view, restored
   * with one click on the panel bar's own tab.

   * WITH — built from the same shared `panelMeta.ts`/`panelIcons.tsx` tables the rail itself reads,
   * so a title or icon can never read differently on the two surfaces.
   *
   * ALL FOURTEEN, `cli`/`shell` INCLUDED — they used to be left out on the (correct, at the time)
   * reasoning that the session panel's own `ShellBand` already offers them at the foot of the
   * screen. But that is a SEPARATE control answering a separate question ("what is docked below the
   * conversation right now"), and `panelIcons.tsx`'s own header already names this exact switcher
   * as one of the three readers `cli`/`shell` carry a `PANEL_META` entry FOR — the omission was the
   * bug, not the design. Opening either one here goes through the very same `openSlotPanel(id)`
   * every other tab uses: `cli`/`shell` default to `bottom` placement, so picking one just makes
   * `ShellBand` show THAT pane and ensures the band is open (exactly what tapping its own embedded
   * tab does); if either was ever moved to the rail on a wider viewport first, picking it here opens
   * it as a full-screen overlay instead — the very same `rightIsCli`/`rightIsShell` branch already
   * used when a desktop reader moves one to the rail. One click handler, both destinations, decided
   * entirely by the panel's own placement — never a fact this switcher has to know.
   *
   * WHICH FOURTEEN ARE OFFERED follows PLACEMENT, not a hardcoded list: `railPanels`/`bottomPanels`
   * already exclude anything `hidden` (spec's own rule — "a hidden panel must not appear in the
   * mobile menu either"), so a panel hidden on a wider viewport of this same browser stays hidden
   * here too, and one moved between rail and bottom on desktop is reachable here exactly the same
   * either way — "moving" has no separate meaning on a phone with no rail to move BETWEEN, so this
   * switcher simply shows every panel that is placed anywhere reachable, which is what "moved" comes
   * down to once the rail itself is gone.
   *
   * `on` reads `isPanelShown`, not `slotLayout.right === id` — the old test, correct only for a
   * rail-placed panel opened into the right slot, went permanently false for a bottom-placed one
   * (the ordinary case for `cli`/`shell`) even while `ShellBand` was genuinely showing it.
   *
   * NO OVERFLOW CONTROL: `flexWrap: 'wrap'` lets the row grow to as many lines as fourteen tiles
   * need rather than clipping — the rail's own "more" button (spec §4) exists because the RAIL
   * cannot grow (a fixed-height column, `overflow: hidden`, spec's own rule), while this row sits in
   * NORMAL FLOW above a column that already scrolls; a control whose only reason to exist is "some
   * icons do not fit" has nothing to answer here, and porting it would be a button that always says
   * zero.

   * the four right-slot panels that carry no toolbar of their own, is `PanelFixedControls` — the SAME
   * fixed trio (full screen, minimize, gear) every panel now carries, in the SAME order, through the
   * SAME shared builder (`lib/panelMenu.ts`) `ShellBand`'s own bar and the new bottom bands use, so
   * this can never disagree with what those say about an identical gesture. `panelFixedControlsFor`
   * (this trio, computed above — moved ahead of `tabPane` since that function now needs it to build
   * `rightTabPane`'s own `headerControls`) is the shared answer; see its own header there for the
   * "one header row" split this page went through.
   *
   * `cli`/`shell` ALONE — the two right-slot panels with no header of their own for the trio to
   * fold into. This is now THEIR one header row: the panel's own name on the left (so it is no
   * longer a controls-only strip — the same "title, then controls, right-aligned" shape every
   * other panel's own header now carries), `minWidth: 0` plus `textOverflow: ellipsis` on that
   * span so a long name truncates instead of pushing the trio off the row, and the trio on the
   * right. `null` (never an empty div) wherever `panelFixedControlsFor` has nothing to draw —

  // ONE PANE, POSITIONED BY THE LAYOUT — never one pane per layout.
  //
  // `artifactsPane` used to be written into FOUR separate `return`s, one per `ArtifactLayout`, and
  // React reconciles by POSITION: four positions are four different elements, so crossing a
  // breakpoint unmounted the whole aside and mounted a new one. That is not a flicker. The Studio's
  // entire composition — `Layer`, `mountedEditors`, `StudioBody`'s one DOM shape — exists to make
  // sure an unsaved buffer survives every move a reader can make inside it, and the surface holding
  // it was throwing the lot away the moment the WINDOW changed size. On a phone the window changes
  // size when you turn it over, or when the keyboard opens.
  //
  // Measured at 390x844 on a live session, before this: two files open in the Studio, the second
  // one edited and the strip reading `artifactLayout.test.ts — não salvo`, 1 Monaco instance. One
  // resize to 1600x900 and the same reads gave `openTabs: []`, `monaco: 0`, and a re-fetched tree.
  // The typed text was gone, with nothing on screen having said so.
  //
  // So the pane is ONE element in ONE slot and the LAYOUT is a style. Everything that differed
  // between the four branches — fixed over the phone, absolute over the conversation, a column in a
  // flex row — is `artOuter`/`artInner` below, and every other slot in this return is always
  // present (`null` when it draws nothing) so no sibling can shift the pane's index either.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated rather than discovered: the CENTRE still changes shape across
  // 768px (a phone has a back bar and a title; a desktop has the edge strip), so `SessionPanel`
  // remounts on that crossing exactly as it always has. The conversation is re-read from the
  // server and a half-typed prompt is held by `composerStore`, so nothing is lost there — which is
  // precisely what was NOT true of the Studio, whose buffers live nowhere but in its own DOM. (So a
  // drop that is not a layout change — the panel closing, the page navigating — is ASKED about
  // first; see `leaveGuard`.)

   * handle above, or the `split` shell's own width transition — `ResizeObserver` on `artOuter`
   * itself) and the ROOM around it changing without the aside's own box changing size at all (a
   * sidebar drag or a window resize shrinks `splitRef`, which shifts an `overlay` aside's `right: 0`
   * position with no size change of its own — `ResizeObserver` would miss that, `splitRoom` catches
   * it, because it is already recomputed for exactly that set of causes; see `panelWidth`, above).
   *
   * **The `overlay` shell (below `SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH`) opens on `transform` alone — `width` never
   * changes — so `ResizeObserver` never fires for it at all**, reported by review as a Critical: the
   * one synchronous `report()` this effect used to make was also the LAST one, taken while the aside
   * still sat translated off-screen (its mount-time `translateX(100%)`), and nothing corrected it
   * until an unrelated cause re-ran the effect — the Filtros panel then measured "plenty of room"
   * against a box that had since visually slid into view, reproducing the original occlusion on an
   * ordinary first open. Two changes close it: `report()` reads `restingLeftEdge`, which discounts
   * the box's own `translateX` and so answers with the SETTLED position regardless of where the
   * slide currently sits (correct even at that very first off-screen frame); and the effect also
   * re-measures on the box's own `transitionend`/`transitioncancel` (filtered to the `transform`
   * property, so an unrelated child transition cannot trigger it) and whenever `asideIn` itself
   * flips, as a second line of defense for whatever `restingLeftEdge` cannot see.
   *
   * `getBoundingClientRect()`, not the observer's own `contentRect` — that rect is relative to the
   * element's OWN padding box, not the viewport, so it cannot answer "where is this on screen."

   * including the PIN button itself, is inside this and so never counts as "away"); did it land on
   * THE RAIL (`closest('[data-panel-rail]')`) or on ANY portaled menu this workspace draws
   * (`closest('[role="menu"]')` — the rail's own right-click move/hide menu and its overflow/eye
   * tile dropdowns are portaled to `document.body`, outside the rail's own DOM subtree, so without
   * this a right-click on the rail's icon and then a pick from its OWN menu would minimize the very
   * panel the picked verb was about). Clicking the rail is SWITCHING panels, never "clicking away".
   *
   * ESC IS THE SAME DECISION (item 2, "Esc deveria fazer o mesmo") — it did not exist at all before
   * this pass (there was no `'Escape'` handler anywhere in this file). It shares `overlayOutsideAction`
   * rather than a bare unconditional minimize, so a PINNED panel is left alone by Esc too — the same
   * "this stays until I say so" promise the pin makes against an accidental click.

                 menu instead, which is where the panel's own entry already is. A tile in the
                 bottom nav's "More" sheet was the other candidate and is wrong: that sheet is
                 machine-wide chrome and the Studio is about the SESSION you have open, which
                 only this menu has.
                 ABSENT when the gate is closed, never greyed — the same `editorEnabled` the
                 aside reads, the server's own already-resolved answer with a CENTRAL already
                 subtracted where the app publishes it (`lib/editorGate.ts`): the `/api/fleet`
                 prefix is refused on a central, and this row used to be the one entry that
                 offered the Studio there.
                 NO `badge` ANY MORE (see §2 of the slots/references design): the desktop button
                 dropped its `NewTag` for a dot that clears after the first open, and a row with
                 no icon corner to put a dot on just drops the mark rather than keeping a word the
                 other nav lost. The beta caveat stays on the Studio's own top bar, one tap away.
                 `on: isPanelShown(slotLayout, 'studio')` mirrors the desktop button's pressed
                 state — the same `panelSlots.ts` layout, so a reader who opened the Studio from
                 THIS row and then came back to the menu finds it marked current. Built by
                 `studioMenuRow` (above `SessionsPage`) rather than as a literal here, so its `on`
                 wiring is asserted directly — see `SessionsPage.test.tsx`. */

          pane is fully closed, and nesting it there would unmount it the moment that pane closed.
          Mounted only once the reader has actually opened it (`isPanelShown`), and only while the
          gate is open — the same two conditions `ArtifactsAside`'s own Studio mount used to read
          before this feature moved the Studio out of it.

          MOUNTED THROUGH `mountStudioHostPanel` (module-level, above), not a hand-written
          `cond && (<StudioHost .../>)`: a move (right↔bottom) changes `target` below without
          changing WHETHER this is shown, and `mountPanel` (`lib/panelSlots.ts`) inside that function
          is what makes "no `key=` of its own, exactly one call site" a fact about a function every
          caller shares rather than a rule this page has to keep re-observing. `sessionsPage.lint.
          test.ts`'s own I4 block pins this call SITE's literal (a `key` at ANY field position fails
          it — fix wave 3 restored the whole-literal scan a prior fix wave had narrowed to an
          occurrence count), `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` pins `mountPanel` itself, and
          `studioHostMount.test.ts` (I4) calls `mountStudioHostPanel` DIRECTLY and inspects the real
          `React.ReactElement` it returns. **None of those three is what makes a stray `key` on the
          object literal below impossible to compile** — a source scan and a call through the real
          function both stay green for a `key` reached only via an intermediate typed variable, which
          neither one ever executes or reads. `StudioHostMountParams.key: never` (its own doc comment)
          is the one guarantee that closes that: it fails `tsc` for the literal below AND for that
          routed shape, pinned in `studioHostMountParams.types.test.ts`. */}
