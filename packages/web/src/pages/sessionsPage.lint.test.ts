 * `SPLIT_MIN` unmounted the entire aside and mounted a new one. The Studio's whole composition
 * (`Layer`, `mountedEditors`, `StudioBody`'s one DOM shape) exists so that an unsaved buffer
 * survives every move a reader makes inside it, and the page around it was discarding the lot
 * whenever the WINDOW changed size — which on a phone is turning it over, or opening the keyboard.
 *
 * MEASURED at 390x844 on a live session before the fix: two files open, the second edited and the
 * strip reading `artifactLayout.test.ts — não salvo`, one Monaco instance. After a single resize to
 * 1600x900 the same reads answered `openTabs: []`, `monaco: 0` and a re-fetched tree.
 *
 * This is the same class of invariant as the edge-strip shape above, and the same reason it is a

 * (`contentsPane={artifactsPane}`), so the regex now legitimately matches the right slot's own JSX
 * child AND that one prop line. The invariant this test exists to protect is untouched: there is
 * still exactly ONE `const artifactsPane = (...)` in this file (asserted below), and the right and

/**
 * I4 — THE STUDIO'S MOVE-NEVER-REMOUNTS GUARANTEE HAS A MOUNT SITE, AND THE MOUNT SITE CAN BREAK IT
 * ALL BY ITSELF. `StudioHost.lint.test.ts` pins the re-parenting MECHANISM inside `StudioHost.tsx`;
 * it says nothing about how this page MOUNTS that component, and a reviewer proved the gap three
 * times over. First: adding `key={rightIsStudio ? 'right' : 'bottom'}` to a hand-written
 * `cond && (<StudioHost .../>)` — every test in the suite at the time stayed green, because
 * `StudioHost.lint.test.ts` only reads `StudioHost.tsx` and `panelSlots.test.ts` never renders
 * anything. THE FIX for that was moving the mount through `lib/panelSlots.ts`'s `mountPanel`, pinned
 * against REAL `React.ReactElement` objects in `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts`. Second, in the
 * RE-REVIEW: adding `key: rightIsStudio ? 'right' : 'bottom',` into the literal PROPS object at that
 * call, still inside this page — `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` only ever called `mountPanel` with a
 * `Dummy` component and hand-built props, so it never touched THIS call site and stayed green; only
 * this file's own source scan (a full scan of the literal, back then) caught it.
 *
 * THAT SCAN WAS THEN WEAKENED, and a THIRD re-review caught it: the fix that introduced
 * `mountStudioHostPanel` (the module-level function above) replaced the working "scan the whole
 * literal for a `key:` field, anywhere" test with one that only checks how many times the fixed
 * `CALL_GUARD` PREFIX string occurs. A `key` planted as the object's FIRST field still broke that
 * prefix string and was still (coincidentally) caught; a `key` planted as its LAST field, after
 * `target: studioTarget,`, left the prefix untouched and passed every `bun test` in the suite
 * — only `bun tsc --noEmit` caught it, and only because a directly-passed object literal still
 * triggers excess-property checking regardless of field order. The whole-literal scan below is that
 * protection RESTORED, not a new one — see `SRC.slice(start, close)` rather than a fixed-string
 * `.split(...).length`.
 *
 * `mountStudioHostPanel` also carries `studioHostMount.test.ts` (genuine structural coverage of the
 * function's own contract, calling it directly with real `React.ReactElement` objects) and
 * `studioHostMountParams.types.test.ts` (`StudioHostMountParams.key: never`, a TYPE-level guarantee
 * that reaches shapes NEITHER a source scan nor a call through the real function can see — a `key`
 * routed through an intermediate typed variable, or merged in via a later spread, since neither one
 * puts `key:` as literal text near this call, and neither one calls `mountStudioHostPanel` with a
 * bare `key` field for `studioHostMount.test.ts` to catch either).
 *
 * So THIS file owns two things: the SHAPE of the JSX call (exactly one, passing the same `shown`
 * condition every gate on this page uses rather than a slot-dependent ternary), and the CONTENT of
 * its literal (no `key:` field, at any position).
