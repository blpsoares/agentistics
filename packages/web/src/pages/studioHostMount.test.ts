/**
 * studioHostMount.test.ts — `mountStudioHostPanel`'s own guarantee, asserted against REAL
 * `React.ReactElement` objects rather than against source text or a stand-in component.
 *
 * `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts` already proves `mountPanel` itself never reads a `key` out of its
 * props — but only ever against a `Dummy` component it builds by hand, so a `key` slipped into the
 * REAL props object `SessionsPage.tsx` hands to `mountPanel` for `StudioHost` was invisible to it.
 * That is exactly the regression a reviewer planted and the exact gap this file closes: it imports
 * `mountStudioHostPanel` from `SessionsPage.tsx` — the very function that page's own JSX calls — and
 * calls it directly, with no DOM and no jsdom needed, the same way `panelSlots.mountPanel.test.ts`
 * inspects `mountPanel`'s output.
 *
 * See `mountStudioHostPanel`'s own doc comment (`SessionsPage.tsx`) for why the fields it forwards
 * to `mountPanel` are picked EXPLICITLY rather than spread from its params — a `key` added to the
 * params object at the JSX call site is dropped there, before it ever reaches `mountPanel`.
