/**
 * useHardwarePressureWatch — the rail's own Hardware icon turning red, plus the notification that
 * goes with it (addendum item 6, right-icon-rail spec).
 *
 * REUSES THE EXISTING HARDWARE SOURCE: `useHardwareSnapshot` is the very hook `HardwareModal.tsx`
 * already polls `/api/hardware-resources` through (every 5s) — this is a second CALL of that same
 * function, not a second reader of the machine, so the figures the rail's icon reacts to are
 * provably the same ones the modal draws. The PURE decision of what counts as pressure lives in
 * `lib/hardwarePressure.ts`, tested on its own; this hook is only the wiring — sample, decide,
 * remember the last reading, and notify exactly on the crossing into critical.
 *
 * THE NOTIFICATION CHANNEL IS THE EXISTING ONE TOO (`pushNotification`, `lib/notifications.ts`) —
 * client-originated, server-deduped, rendered by the same bell every other client-side notice goes
 * through. No new delivery mechanism.
 *
 * `pressureWatchStep` BELOW IS THE WHOLE DECISION, PULLED OUT PURE (rail-loose-ends, item 3) — this
 * repo has no jsdom to render the hook itself and drive it with a live snapshot, so the hook's own
 * body is reduced to the one thing that genuinely needs React (the `useHardwareSnapshot` poll and
 * the two refs/state it feeds), and everything it DECIDES — the icon's colour, whether a
 * notification fires and what it says — is a plain function call a test can drive directly with a
 * constructed `HardwarePressureInput`, the same pattern `usePlanBasis.test.ts`'s
 * `computePlanBasisView` already uses for a hook this package cannot otherwise test.
