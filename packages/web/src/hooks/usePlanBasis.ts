/**
 * usePlanBasis.ts — turn the day-decomposed API cost plus the user's billing timeline into the
 * plan basis, once per render of the whole app.
 *
 * Computed ONE place and passed down, never re-derived per surface: two surfaces that each cut A
 * their own way would tell two different stories about the same filter, and the whole point of
 * the basis is that every cost on the page agrees.
 *
 * This module is wiring. Every decision lives in `@agentistics/core/billing`; what happens here is
 * the walk over `apiCostByDay` that splits A into "on subscription days", "on api days" and
 * "excluded", using `coveredDayKeys` as the only authority on which day is which.
