/** PURE: which project directories need their git facts read, and where those facts land.
 *
 *  `getGitRemote` and `getProjectGitStats` used to be called from inside `scanProjectDir`, which
 *  exists inside the walk of `~/.claude/projects`. A repository was therefore discovered as a SIDE
 *  EFFECT of Claude having a project directory: sessions from every other harness inherited a remote
 *  only through `backfillGitRemote`, which links a remote-less session to one that another session
 *  at the same path already resolved — and until a Claude session existed there, none had.
 *
 *  Measured on a real machine before this change: claude 163 sessions / 95 with a remote, codex
 *  10 / 0, copilot 8 / 1, gemini 15 / 1.
 *
 *  A repository is a property of a DIRECTORY. So the plan is keyed on `project_path` from any
 *  harness, and the resolution runs once per path. */

 *  git again every build would spend a process to learn the same nothing. This is what keeps the
 *  change close to cost-neutral — the extra reads are exactly the paths that report nothing today. */

 *    repo-bound token (`stampCiSessions`); a local `git config` read must not be able to override
 *    that, and neither must a second pass over the same session.
