/**
 * transcript-state.ts — reading a LIVE Claude transcript by what it has WRITTEN SINCE LAST TIME.
 *
 * The IO half of `transcript-cursor.ts`, which holds every rule this makes a decision with and
 * explains why the rules are what they are. In one sentence: `parse-cache.ts` spares a transcript
 * that has not changed, a live one changes on every turn, and so the parser re-read and re-parsed
 * the whole file on every rebuild for as long as its session ran. This keeps the walk instead.
 *
 * WHAT A CALLER GETS is a `ClaudeParseState` that has been folded over every complete line of the
 * file, however it got there — resumed from a cursor, or rebuilt from scratch because the cursor
 * could not be trusted. The two are indistinguishable in the answer and are distinguished in
 * `mode`, which exists so the saving can be MEASURED rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO is decide anything about sessions. It reads one file and folds it; whether
 * that state becomes a `SessionMeta` or an `EnrichResult` is `parse-cache-jsonl.ts`'s business, and
 * both finish from the same walk — which is also why the memo is keyed on the FILE alone and not on
 * the caller: the facts a transcript carries do not depend on who asked.

 * session's tokens and its cost. `data.ts` runs up to 30 of these at once and a background
 * stale-while-revalidate rebuild can overlap a streamed one, so the arrival is real.
 *
 * WHETHER THE INTERLEAVE ITSELF HAPPENS was NOT observed: removing this guard, ten concurrent reads
 * of one growing file still folded once under bun 1.3.14, because its fs promises happen to settle
 * in an order that lets each read finish before the next plans. That is a scheduling detail of one
 * runtime version, not a property of this code, and the failure it would cause is a silent doubling
 * of somebody's cost. So the promise is shared and the question does not arise — the rule
 * `fleet-baseline.ts` already applies to its own scan, for the same reason.
