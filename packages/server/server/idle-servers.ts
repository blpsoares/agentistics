/**
 * idle-servers.ts — PURE. A second `agentop server` that is running and serving NOTHING.
 *
 * ## The incident this exists for
 *
 * Two `agentop server` processes ran side by side for seventy minutes on a real machine:
 *
 * ```
 * 517      ~/.local/bin/agentop server            ← systemd, holding 47291/47292
 * 3189270  bun packages/server/bin/cli.ts server  ← started by hand from the checkout
 * ```
 *
 * The second could not bind the ports and **kept working anyway**: the file watcher does not depend
 * on a listening socket, so it held 2367 inotify watches and recomputed the whole API response on
 * every transcript write from twelve sessions — 72% of a core and 1.1 GB, serving nobody.
 *
 * Nothing in the product could see it. The conflict model knows `native` versus `docker` and merges
 * the two into one row, and **a compiled binary and `bun run` from a checkout are both native**, so
 * two servers collapsed into one line that said everything was fine. And the runtime probe asks
 * `lsof -sTCP:LISTEN`, which by construction can only ever find the one that WON the port.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A server process that is not the listener is not a second opinion, it is waste. There is no case
 * where two of them is what somebody wanted: they read the same files, write the same caches and
 * fight over the same port. So it is reported as a fault with the pid, and the pid is the whole
 * point — "something is wrong" that cannot be acted on is a worse message than none.
 *
 * The listener itself is never reported. Nor is THIS process: the cockpit runs inside `agentop`, and
 * a rule that flagged its own pid would report a conflict on every healthy machine.

/**
 * Whether a command line is an agentop SERVER — PURE.

 * `bun packages/server/bin/cli.ts server`. Both end in the verb, and the verb is the thing that
 * makes a process a server.
 *
