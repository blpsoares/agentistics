/**
 * billing-detect.ts — the impure half of billing detection: read the files, extract the whitelist,
 * hand the result to the pure `detectBilling` in @agentistics/core.
 *
 * Same split as `codex.ts` / `codex-parse.ts`: all filesystem contact lives here, all reasoning
 * lives in the pure module, and this file holds no logic worth testing beyond "did it extract the
 * right fields, and only those".
 *
 * ── THIS MODULE IS A NARROW WINDOW ONTO SENSITIVE FILES ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The files it opens are the most sensitive this product touches. Besides the plan facts, they
 * hold live OAuth secrets, the user's mail address, and the identifiers of their account and
 * organization. NONE of those may be read, copied, logged, audited or returned, and none of their
 * field names appears anywhere in this file — `billing-detect.test.ts` reads this module's own
 * source and fails if one does. A field this module cannot name is a field it cannot leak.
 *
 * The narrow `BillingSignals` type is the contract; `pick()` below is the only place a value
 * crosses from a parsed file into it, and it takes a fixed list of keys rather than an object.
 *
 * Anthropic's key variable is reduced to the literal `'set'` on the way in: its PRESENCE is the
 * signal and its value is a credential we have no reason to hold, not even in memory.
 *
 * On macOS the credentials file does not exist — that data lives in the login Keychain. This
 * module does NOT shell out to `security` to reach it: probing the Keychain raises a system
 * prompt, and a metrics dashboard has no business asking someone to unlock their keychain. An
 * absent signal is simply absent, and the chain falls through to the next one.
 *
 * ── EXPOSURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The route is registered in `capability-guard.ts` under `localTranscripts` and additionally
 * 404s on a central. Detection describes ONE machine's own configuration; a central aggregating
 * many machines has no use for its operator's, and the result must never enter an ingest body,
 * a team document or an audit event.
