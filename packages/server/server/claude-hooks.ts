/**
 * claude-hooks.ts — **pure**: what agentop puts into a user's `~/.claude/settings.json`, how it
 * merges with whatever is already in there, and how it takes it back out again.
 *
 * That file is not ours. It holds other people's hooks, other tools' keys, and keys this version of
 * agentop has never heard of. So every function here READS a settings object and RETURNS a new one
 * with exactly one thing changed — it never rebuilds the document from a schema it believes in, and
 * it never touches a key it did not write. A `JSON.parse` → mutate-what-I-know → `JSON.stringify`
 * round-trip that drops an unknown key destroys configuration that was working, silently, which is
 * the failure this module is shaped to make impossible.
 *
 * Three rules the tests pin:
 *  - **Refuse rather than overwrite.** A `settings.json` whose `hooks` is a string is not a file to
 *    fix; it is a file to leave alone and report. Every plan returns a discriminated result, and the
 *    caller writes nothing on `ok: false`.
 *  - **Installing twice changes nothing.** `changed: false` is what the second run reports, and the
 *    settings object comes back untouched (=== the input), so the caller does not even rewrite it.
 *  - **Uninstalling is the exact inverse.** It removes OUR hook entry and the containers that exist
 *    only to hold it, and nothing else. A group that also carries someone else's hook keeps that
 *    hook and its group.
 *
 * ## Why the command string is the identity
 *
 * A Claude Code hook entry is `{ type, command, timeout }`. There is no field for "who installed
 * this", and inventing an unknown key inside someone else's schema is how a settings file stops
 * validating on the next release. So OUR entry is recognised by the command it runs — an `agentop`
 * binary invoked with the verb pair `hooks context` — and the version it was written at travels in
 * that same command as `--hook-version N`. It is self-describing: `agentop hooks status` can read a
 * file it has no memory of writing, including one a user hand-edited or copied from another
 * machine, without a second store on the side that could disagree with it.
 */

/**
 * Bumped when the hook CONTRACT changes — the verbs called, what they print, or which events are
 * registered. An installed hook at a lower version is reported as stale by `status` and rewritten
 * in place by `install`.
 *
 * v2 added the `Stop` hook: an install that predates it carries only `SessionStart`, so it is
 * stale by exactly the definition above and `install` brings it up to both.

/**
 * The two Claude Code events agentop registers on, and why there are two.
 *
 * They answer different questions and cost different things:
 *
 *  - **`SessionStart` → `hooks context`** injects the FACTS a starting session cannot know: which
 *    sessions are running now, which is blocked, which task reopens here. It prints nothing when
 *    the fleet is empty, so a quiet machine pays no tokens.
 *  - **`Stop` → `events emit`** records that this session finished a turn. It is the EXACT half of
 *    the event channel — no polling, no inference, Claude saying so itself — and it is the only
 *    reason the channel can report the end of a Claude turn instantly rather than up to five
 *    seconds later. It prints nothing at all: it writes one line to the inbox and exits.
 *
 * Registered as a table rather than two constants so `planHookInstall` / `planHookRemoval` /
 * `readHookStatus` take an event and there is exactly ONE merge implementation. A second copy of
 * the settings merge for the second hook would be a second set of rules about somebody else's file.
