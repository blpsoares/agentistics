/**
 * notifications-context.ts — builds the (impure) `NotificationAuthorityContext` a request needs
 * to scope its notification history, ONCE per request. `notifications-authority.ts` stays pure and
 * knows nothing about Mongo; this is the one place that fetches the machines/accounts it reads.
 *
 * Tag subjects are not wired here yet: nothing in the product currently emits a tag-scoped
 * notification, so `readableTagIds` is always empty (which `subjectVisibleTo` already treats as
 * "fail closed" for a non-owner) rather than guessing at a resolution nobody needs yet. Wiring it
 * up is: fetch the visible tags via `tags-store.ts` + `tags-authority.ts`'s `canReadTag` for the
 * principal, same as `tags-handlers.ts` already does for GET /api/tags.
