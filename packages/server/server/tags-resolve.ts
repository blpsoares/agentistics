/**
 * tags-resolve.ts — PURE resolution of a tag's sources to the sessions they cover.
 *
 * A tag's sources are an OR union: a session belongs to the tag if it matches ANY source.
 * Resolution returns a SET of sessions, which is what makes the aggregate dedupe-correct —
 * a session matching two sources is present once, never summed twice.
 *
 * `team` and `account` resolve dynamically (at query time), so a machine added to a team later
 * is automatically covered without editing the tag.
 *
 * No Mongo, no auth, no I/O — unit-tested with plain objects.
