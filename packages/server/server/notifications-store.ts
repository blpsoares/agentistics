/**
 * notifications-store.ts — the bell's history, persisted ON THE MACHINE (or on the central).
 *
 * WHY NOT localStorage: the history is the user's inbox, not a browser preference. Opening the
 * dashboard from a phone must show the same notifications the desktop shows, and localStorage is
 * per-browser — a phone would always start empty. The server is the source of truth; a client
 * holds a cache at most.
 *
 * WHY NOT preferences.json: `writePreferences` merges a whole object on every PUT
 * (`{...current, ...prefs}`), so an unrelated preference change (theme, language) would rewrite
 * the notification list, and two concurrent PUTs would clobber each other's entries. Preferences
 * are small, bounded config; this is an append-heavy log with its own lifecycle. Separate file.
 *
 * CENTRAL vs MACHINE: a central's history belongs to the central and a machine's to the machine.
 * In Docker they are already isolated (the central mounts a named volume at ~/.agentistics), but
 * the filename is mode-dependent as well so a NATIVE central sharing a home dir with a native
 * machine still cannot mix the two inboxes.
 *
 * THE EVENT IS THE INSTANCE'S; THE STATE IS PERSONAL. A notification is a fact about this
 * instance, stored ONCE — never duplicated per account. What is per-account is what each person
 * did with it: `readBy` (who has seen it) and `hiddenFor` (who dismissed it). On a central,
 * dismissing hides the row for whoever asked and leaves it for everyone else; on a machine, where
 * there is exactly one user, it deletes.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY: two tabs — or a desktop and a phone — hit the same server process, so every
 * mutation runs as a read-modify-write serialized through `serialize`. Without it, "dismiss A" and
 * "dismiss B" firing together would each write the list they read before the other landed, and one
 * of the two deletions would be silently resurrected.
