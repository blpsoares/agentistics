/**
 * cli-central.ts — the `agentop central …` command handler.
 *
 * Two paths, chosen automatically:
 *
 *  1. REPO path — when a `central.sh` is found in the agentistics checkout (dev, or running
 *     `agentop central` from inside the repo). We just shell out to that script, inheriting
 *     stdio so its interactive prompts and log streaming work naturally. Behavior unchanged.
 *
 *  2. STANDALONE path — the compiled binary run from ANY directory, with no repo present.
 *     We can't build the image from source, so we materialize a small Docker Compose that
 *     PULLS the published central image (ghcr.io/blpsoares/agentistics:<version>) into
 *     ~/.agentistics/central/, generate central.env interactively on first run, and drive
 *     `docker compose` directly — no repo, no clone required.
 *
 * Either path can also be STREAMED (`CentralRunOptions.streamed`), which is how the control center
 * runs it: children are piped instead of inheriting the terminal, so their output can be shown
 * inside a pane rather than over the frame Ink is painting. A streamed run asks NOTHING — see
 * `planCentralStart`, which is how a caller knows whether the action it wants has a question in it.
