/**
 * session-context.ts — **pure**: what `agentop hooks context` tells a starting Claude Code session
 * about the assistants already running on this machine.
 *
 * The division of labour with the skill is the whole design, and it is worth stating once:
 *
 *  - the **skill** (`claude-skill.ts`) is KNOWLEDGE. It does not change between sessions, so it is
 *    loaded by the model when the task calls for it and costs nothing when it does not;
 *  - this **hook** is FACTS. Which sessions exist right now, which one is blocked on a permission
 *    prompt, which task can be reopened here. None of that can live in a static file, and all of it
 *    is stale by the time the next session starts.
 *
 * Which is why the one thing this function must be able to do is **say nothing**. On a machine with
 * no agentop sessions it returns `null`, the hook prints nothing, and the session pays zero tokens
 * for it. A SessionStart hook that injected a paragraph into every session — including every
 * session that will never start a second assistant — is the design this one exists instead of.
