/**
 * event-line.ts — PURE. One event, one line, and how to read a line somebody else wrote.
 *
 * The inbox is append-only JSONL because that is the format a later reader can start reading in the
 * middle of. Two properties matter and both are tested:
 *
 *  - **A line is exactly one line.** Everything written goes through `serializeEvent`, which strips
 *    newlines out of the free text it carries. A screen tail with a newline in it would otherwise
 *    split one event into two half-lines, and the reader would drop both.
 *  - **An unreadable line is skipped, never fatal.** The file survives upgrades, crashes mid-write
 *    and a version of agentop that wrote fields this one has never heard of. `parseEvents` returns
 *    what it could read and COUNTS what it could not, so `agentop events status` can say "4 lines
 *    in this file are not readable by this version" instead of the file silently reading as empty.
 *
 * Unknown fields are preserved on read (the object is passed through), so a newer producer's extra
 * fields survive a round trip through an older reader that only re-serializes what it parsed.
