/**
 * event-store.ts — the inbox on disk. Every DECISION here is already made by a pure module
 * (`event-line.ts` for the bytes, `event-rotate.ts` for the cursor and the cap); this file opens
 * files.
 *
 * ## Why there is an inbox at all
 *
 * A Claude session only exists while it is being invoked. An event delivered to a session that is
 * parked is an event that happened to nobody. The inbox is what makes the channel work for the
 * consumer that is not running: it reads what happened since it last looked, on its own schedule.
 * Everything else in this feature — the socket, the toast — is a way of making that read HAPPEN
 * SOONER, never a replacement for it.
 *
 * ## Appends are serialized in-process and atomic on disk
 *
 * Several producers can exist (the daemon, a foreground `agentop events run`, the Stop hook firing
 * from Claude Code). `appendFile` with `O_APPEND` is atomic for writes under PIPE_BUF on Linux and
 * each line is far smaller than that, so two writers interleave whole lines rather than shredding
 * one. The in-process chain on top of it keeps `seq` monotonic within one producer; two producers
 * can in principle both hand out the same seq, which is why `seq` is documented as a CURSOR
 * ordinal and never as an identity.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * The file holds screen tails, which are the user's own text. It is created 0600 under
 * `~/.agentistics`, the same directory (and the same expectation) as the rest of this app's local
 * state, and nothing in this feature sends it off the machine.
