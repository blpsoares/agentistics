/**
 * producer.ts — the thing that watches. One long-lived poller, and everything that follows from
 * that being long-lived.
 *
 * ## Why this MUST be long-lived, and why it therefore rides along with the daemon
 *
 * `createSessionsPoller` holds two things between polls: the digest of each session's last frame,
 * and each session's last activity. Both are in memory, and both are what make the answer correct:
 *
 *  - **Movement is the only universal "working" signal.** For several harnesses the screen looks
 *    identical whether they are streaming output or sitting idle — codex draws the same footer
 *    either way — so the only proof of work is that the frame CHANGED since last time. A process
 *    that polls once has no "last time".
 *  - **tmux's own `session_activity` is not a substitute.** Measured on this machine while writing
 *    this: a session that had been working continuously for 53 minutes reported its last tmux
 *    activity 3185 seconds earlier, because nothing was attached to it. That is well past the
 *    marker staleness window, so a single-invocation read discards the `esc to interrupt` marker
 *    too and lands on `waiting`.
 *
 * Put together: **a single-invocation poll reports working sessions as finished.** A `agentop
 * events` implemented as a cron job or a per-invocation check would announce that five sessions
 * finished at the moment they all started. False notifications are worse than none — people stop
 * looking — so the producer is a loop that keeps its memory, and there is no single-shot event
 * source in this design except the Claude `Stop` hook, which is exact by construction and infers
 * nothing.
 *
 * That settles the daemon question. A separate process the user must remember to start is a process
 * that will be dead when it matters, so the producer runs INSIDE the daemon `agentop server`
 * already starts (`otel-watcher`), where it costs one extra tmux capture per session per five
 * seconds and starts with the machine. `agentop events run` starts the same producer in the
 * foreground for someone who does not run the server — and `agentop events status` says which of
 * the two is up, because "nothing is producing events" must be a visible state.
 *
 * ## First poll writes nothing
 *
 * See `event-plan.ts`: a session the producer has never seen has no previous state, so nothing can
 * be said to have changed about it. Restarting the daemon therefore does not replay the fleet into
 * the inbox as a flood of "started waiting".
