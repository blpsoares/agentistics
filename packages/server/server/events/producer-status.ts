/**
 * producer-status.ts — is anything actually watching?
 *
 * "No events arrived" has two causes that look identical from the outside: nothing happened, or
 * nobody was watching. The second is the one that makes a person stop trusting the channel, so it
 * has to be a state `agentop events status` can NAME. A running producer stamps a small heartbeat
 * file; `status` reads it and reports the producer as running, stale (a heartbeat whose process is
 * gone, i.e. a daemon that was killed) or absent.
 *
 * The heartbeat is throttled rather than written every tick: the poll runs every five seconds and
 * the point of this file is liveness, not a log.
 *
 * Liveness is confirmed against the PID, not against the timestamp alone — a machine that was
 * suspended for an hour has a stale-looking heartbeat and a perfectly alive daemon.
