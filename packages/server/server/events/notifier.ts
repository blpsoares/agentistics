/**
 * notifier.ts — an event that was written, delivered to whoever asked for it.
 *
 * Writing and delivering are separate steps on purpose. The write is what makes the channel work
 * for a consumer that is not running; delivery is what makes it work SOONER for one that is. A
 * failed delivery is therefore never fatal and never silent: the event is already durable, and the
 * failure is reported so that "my notifications stopped arriving" is a thing the user can be told
 * rather than something they eventually notice.
 *
 * ## Batching
 *
 * One poll can produce several events, and five sessions finishing at once must interrupt a working
 * assistant ONCE. So the events of one batch that a given subscription wants become one peer
 * message. Desktop notifications are the opposite: a toast per event is what a person expects, so
 * they are sent per event but capped, because ten toasts at once is a screen nobody reads.
