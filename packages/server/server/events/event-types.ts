/**
 * event-types.ts — the whole contract of the event channel, in one place.
 *
 * ## What an event is, and what it is deliberately not
 *
 * A `SessionEvent` records that a session CHANGED STATE. It carries facts: when, which session,
 * which task, from what to what, and — when there is one — the last few lines that were on its
 * screen. It carries **no instruction, no suggestion and no request**.
 *
 * That is a hard boundary, not a style preference. This channel exists so a Claude session
 * orchestrating other assistants knows what is happening without a person relaying it. The distance
 * between "knows what is happening" and "acts on someone's behalf" is one field: an event with an
 * `action`, a `suggest` or a `respondWith` would make the channel the thing that crosses it. So
 * there is no such field, `events-frontier.test.ts` asserts there is none, and the ONE state that
 * would most tempt one — `waiting-approval` — is reported as a fact and nothing more. Nothing in
 * this channel may approve anything for anyone.
 *
 * ## Two sources that are not equivalent
 *
 * `poll` is agentop's own five-second monitor. It reads the SCREEN, so it works for all six
 * harnesses, and it infers — it is the FLOOR, and the floor has to hold for codex, kimi and gemini
 * which have no hook to offer.
 *
 * `hook` is a Claude Code `Stop` hook. It fires when a Claude session finishes answering: exact, no
 * polling, no inference — and Claude only.
 *
 * Both report the same end of turn, so `event-dedupe.ts` decides which one the reader sees.
