/**
 * notify-text.ts — PURE. What an event SAYS, to a person and to another assistant.
 *
 * ## This module is where the boundary is actually held
 *
 * `event-types.ts` makes it structurally impossible for an event to carry an instruction. That is
 * necessary and not sufficient: a message whose every field is a fact can still be written as an
 * order. "Session 3 is blocked — approve it" carries no `action` field and is exactly the thing
 * this channel must never send.
 *
 * So the rules here are rules about WORDS, and `events-frontier.test.ts` checks them:
 *
 *  - Every sentence is in the indicative. It states what happened. No imperative, no "you should",
 *    no "run", no "approve", no question inviting one.
 *  - `waiting-approval` is reported as **"is waiting on a permission prompt"** and stops. The one
 *    thing an orchestrating assistant must not conclude from this channel is that it may answer
 *    that prompt, so the message says who the prompt is for: a person.
 *  - The peer message carries a standing preamble saying the channel is informational. A model
 *    reading a bare status line in its context has to infer what it is for; being told is cheaper
 *    and more reliable than hoping.
 *
 * ## The screen tail
 *
 * It is the user's own text and it travels no further than this machine. It is included because
 * "waiting" without "waiting on WHAT" is a notification people learn to ignore.
