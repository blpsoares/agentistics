/**
 * daemon.ts — the event producer riding along with the daemon that is already running.
 *
 * ## Why it rides along instead of being its own service
 *
 * The producer must be long-lived (see `producer.ts`: a single-invocation poll cannot tell a
 * working session from a finished one, because "working" is proven by the screen having MOVED since
 * last time). Something long-lived has to host it, and the choice was between a new service and one
 * that already exists.
 *
 * A new one loses. It would be a third thing to install, a third systemd unit, and — decisively —
 * a process the user has to remember to start, which means it is dead at the moment the fleet does
 * something worth knowing about. `otel-watcher` is already started by `agentop server`, already
 * covered by `agentop autostart`, and already the thing that lives as long as the machine's
 * agentistics does. So the producer starts here, and `agentop events run` exists for the person who
 * does not run the server at all.
 *
 * ## It never takes the daemon down with it
 *
 * Everything is wrapped: a machine with no tmux reports the reason once and the daemon carries on
 * doing what it was already doing. The event channel is an addition to that process, never a
 * condition of it.
