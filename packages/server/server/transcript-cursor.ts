/**
 * transcript-cursor.ts — resuming a GROWING JSONL transcript where the last read stopped. PURE.
 *
 * `parse-cache.ts` already spares a transcript that has not changed. A LIVE one changes on every
 * turn, so its stamp changes, the row misses, and the parser read the whole file again — from the
 * first byte, re-`JSON.parse`-ing every line it had already parsed. Measured on this machine while
 * the fleet was busy: 16 transcripts written to inside 30 minutes totalling 99,4 MB, the three
 * largest at 26,4 / 21,4 / 12,4 MB, and ONE full `parseSessionJsonl` over them costing 400 / 1004 /
 * 312 ms of pure CPU each. `buildApiResponse` re-runs on a 30 s stale-while-revalidate tick for as
 * long as anybody is watching, so that bill is paid again and again — which is the sustained
 * 66–77 % CPU that took this machine down twice.
 *
 * The cure is to read only the bytes written SINCE the last read and fold them into state that was
 * kept, so a poll costs what the session wrote, not what it has ever written. This module is the
 * decision half of that: it says whether a stored cursor may be resumed from, and never touches a
 * file. `transcript-state.ts` does the reading.
 *
 * THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE IT SAFE
 *
 * 1. **A PARTIAL LINE IS NEVER CONSUMED.** A read of a file another process is appending to lands
 *    wherever that process happened to be; the last line in the buffer is routinely half-written.
 *    `completeLineEnd` stops at the last newline, everything after it stays UNREAD, and the cursor
 *    advances only that far — so the next read starts at the beginning of that line and sees it
 *    whole. This is `windowLines()` in `transcript-window.ts` pointed the other way: that one drops
 *    the partial line at the START of a tail window, this one declines the partial line at the END
 *    of a head window.
 *
 * 2. **AN OFFSET IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE BYTES IT SITS BEHIND.** A cursor is a claim about a file
 *    that is not being held open, and the claim is wrong the moment the file is rewritten rather
 *    than appended to. Two checks, and both err toward re-reading:
 *      - the SIZE may only grow; any shrink means the file is not the one the cursor described;
 *      - the ANCHOR — the last `ANCHOR_BYTES` bytes immediately BEFORE the cursor — is re-read and
 *        compared on every resume. A rewrite that kept the exact byte length AND reproduced the
 *        256 bytes ending at our offset is the only thing that can slip through, and a rewrite of
 *        a conversation cannot do either.
 *
 *    When either check fails the file is read WHOLE, once, and the cursor is re-established from
 *    that read — never patched, never half-applied. That is the shape this repository requires of
 *    a measurement it cannot make safely: fall back to the answer it can make, never a confident
 *    number assembled out of two files.
 *
 * COMPACTION IS NOT A REWRITE, AND THAT WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Claude Code compacts by
 * APPENDING: a `{"type":"system","subtype":"compact_boundary"}` line and then the summary, with the
 * pre-compaction history left exactly where it was. Verified on a real transcript here — two
 * boundaries, at lines 2992 and 6141 of 6229, with all 2991 earlier lines still present. So a
 * compaction advances the cursor like any other turn and every accumulated figure goes on meaning
 * what `parseSessionJsonl` has always made it mean (`compact_count` increments, the earlier turns
 * keep counting). No rule is needed FOR compaction; the rule above is needed in case a harness ever
 * compacts by rewriting, and it catches that without knowing it happened.
