 * non-ignored files, which by definition exist.
 *
 * Fixed by subtracting `git ls-files --deleted` (index paths git can see are missing from the

 * have, and it needs no filesystem access at all beyond what `git` already does internally. A
 * `--deleted` call that itself fails is treated as "nothing known to be deleted" — the listing
