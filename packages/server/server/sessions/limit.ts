/**
 * limit.ts — PURE. When a session stopped because the HARNESS cut it off, and when it may go again.
 *
 * This is a different kind of stop from every other state in `attention.ts`, and the difference is
 * the whole reason it gets its own module rather than another `approval` pattern:
 *
 *  - A `waiting-approval` session is blocked on a person, and answering it costs a keystroke.
 *  - A `limit-blocked` session is blocked on a CLOCK. Nothing anyone types moves it, and a "continue"
 *    sent before the reset is not merely useless — it burns the first request of the new window on a
 *    prompt whose only content is the word continue, and the harness answers it with the same error.
 *
 * So the banner is only half of what this module reads. The other half is the RESET TIME the banner
 * carries, because a fleet-wide resume that ignores it is a button that reliably fails on every row
 * it touches.
 *
 * ## The pattern was captured, never written from memory
 *
 * Same rule as `attention-rules.ts`, and for the same reason: a plausible pattern that never matches
 * fails silently. Captured on 2026-08-14 from three live panes (`agentop-6b23834c1a`,
 * `agentop-d41dc788ef`, `agentop-cbf341b8c8`) with `tmux capture-pane -p`, claude 2.1.231, and
 * re-read byte by byte through `cat -A`:
 *
 * ```
 *   ⎿ ␣You've hit your session limit · resets 6:30pm (America/Sao_Paulo)
 *      /upgrade to increase your usage limit.
 * ```
 *
 * Two things in there would have been guessed wrong. The space before `You've` is a NON-BREAKING
 * space (U+00A0, `M-BM- ` under `cat -A`) and the separator is a MIDDLE DOT (U+00B7, `M-BM-7`) — a
 * pattern written with an ASCII space and an ASCII `-` matches neither. The patterns below therefore
 * anchor on the WORDS and spell every gap `\s+`, which is what makes them survive both the nbsp and
 * the tool-result indent; `limit.test.ts` fails the build if a literal space is ever typed into one.
 * The apostrophe in `You've` really is ASCII (`cat -A` left it alone), and is matched as a character
 * class anyway so a future curly one does not silently switch the feature off.
 *
 * The same sentence also arrives inside a SUBAGENT failure, captured verbatim from the third pane:
 *
 * ```
 *   ● Agent "…" failed: Agent terminated early due to an API error: You've hit your session limit · resets 6:30pm (America/Sao_Paulo)
 * ```
 *
 * That line is matched too, deliberately. The limit belongs to the ACCOUNT, not to the subagent that
 * happened to reach it first, so the parent's very next request fails the same way — and in the pane
 * it was read from, both forms were on screen together.
 *
 * ## Why the tail and not the frame
 *
 * The banner is transcript CONTENT, not chrome. It scrolls with the conversation and stays on screen
 * long after the session has resumed and done more work — so "the banner appears in the frame" would
 * pin a working session to `limit-blocked` until the text happened to scroll off. This is the exact
 * shape of the `esc to interrupt` bug that `MARKER_STALE_MS` exists to correct, met a second time.
 * `detectLimit` is therefore fed the frame TAIL — the last few meaningful lines, the same ones
 * `frameTail` already computes for the detail pane — so the banner counts only while it is still the
 * last thing that happened.
 *
 * The tail is also the only answer to the other way this pattern can misfire, and it is not
 * hypothetical here: agentop is developed with agentop, so a session editing THIS FILE has the
 * banner's words on its screen as source code. `attention-rules.ts` learned that the hard way with
 * `Esc to cancel · Tab to amend`. A quotation sits in the middle of a screen; the thing that just
 * stopped the session sits at the end of it.
