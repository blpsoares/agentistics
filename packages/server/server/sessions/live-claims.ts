/**
 * live-claims.ts — the I/O behind `conversation-claim.ts`: which conversations this machine is
 * driving RIGHT NOW.
 *
 * It lives in its own module, and is used by both `cli-start.ts` (the cockpit) and `cli-session.ts`
 * (the command line), for the reason `task-reopen.ts` was extracted: those two are the SAME gesture
 * written twice, and every time a rule has been added to one of them it has been missing from the
 * other. A lock with a second unlocked entrance is not a lock.
 *
 * The DECISION — what counts as driving a conversation — is the pure `conversationsInUse`. This only
 * gathers the evidence, and only the EXACT kinds of it. See that module's header for why a
 * harness-and-directory guess may never be admitted here.

/**
 * Conversation id → the live session driving it.
 *
 * Three reads, each contributing something the others cannot:
 *
 *  - the BACKEND says which managed rows are alive. Nothing else does: a harness record OUTLIVES its
 *    process (53 files on this machine against about a dozen live ones), so "there is a record" is
 *    not "it is running" — locking on the records alone would refuse to reopen anything that had
 *    ever run, which is every row this verb exists for.
 *  - the HARNESS's own files say which conversation a live session drives, matched by tmux session
 *    name for one we host and by pid for one we merely see. It is the only source that is a fact
 *    rather than a recollection, and the only one that can see an assistant started OUTSIDE agentop
 *    sitting in the very conversation someone is about to reopen.
 *  - the REGISTRY's `conversationId` covers a live row whose harness record cannot be read.
 *
 * Every read is best-effort and every failure degrades to "we do not know", never to a refusal: this
 * guard exists to prevent lost work, not to become a new way of losing the verb.
