/**
 * session-table.ts — PURE. The sessions table, drawn as plain terminal lines.
 *
 * This is the cockpit's table printed instead of mounted: `agentop session ls` asks the same
 * question the Sessions tab answers ("what is running, grouped by where I am working") and a person
 * reading a log wants the same aligned columns and the same section headings. What changes is the
 * DRAWING — ANSI written once to stdout rather than Ink components repainted — and nothing else.
 *
 * So every rule about what a row IS lives in `@agentistics/tui/control/sessions` and is consumed
 * here: `sessionColumns` measures the page, `groupSessions` + `sessionRows` decide the sections and
 * the air between them, `sessionHandle` / `worktreeName` / `sessionMetric` / `padCell` fill the
 * cells. A second implementation of any of them is a second set of rules that agree until the day
 * they do not — this repository has already paid for that once, with a task `open` written twice
 * that left the registry in two different states depending on which one you pressed.
 *
 * Two things ARE this module's own, because they are drawing:
 *
 *  - **Nothing may exceed the width.** Ink truncates an over-wide row with `wrap="truncate"`; a
 *    terminal wraps it, and a wrapped row shears every column under it. `sessionColumns` fits the
 *    row for every width a person actually uses, but at ~20 columns its own floor (the state word
 *    plus a one-character title) is already wider than the terminal — so the last step here CLIPS,
 *    counting only visible characters.
 *  - **Colour is optional and is never measured.** It is applied to a cell that is already padded,
 *    so a pipe and a terminal are the same table with the same column positions.

 *     reading: a pager IS a reader, and when there is no tty to ask, `COLUMNS` is the only thing
 *     left that says how wide the reader is. It is the convention `git` and `ls` follow.
 *  4. The natural width — a pipe that said nothing about a width still gets nothing truncated.
 *
 * A `COLUMNS` that is present but not a width (`abc`, `0`, `-1`, `12.5`) falls through to the next
 * answer rather than throwing or being coerced: the variable is set by all sorts of things, and a
 * junk value is a statement about the environment, not an instruction. There is no MINIMUM applied
