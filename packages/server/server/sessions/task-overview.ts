/**
 * task-overview.ts — PURE. The board as a whole: what is in flight, what shipped, and what a
 * delivery costs on average.
 *
 * This is the FIRST thing the page shows, before any kanban. The board's own shape ("which column
 * is full") is a tracking question and comes second; the question people open this for is "what is
 * my work costing me".
 *
 * The averages are the part that can lie, so each one states its DENOMINATOR:
 *  - a task nobody could price is excluded from the cost average and COUNTED, or the average is of
 *    a set the reader cannot see;
 *  - delivery time averages over DELIVERED tasks only — an open task has no duration (`task-stats`),
 *    and treating "so far" as a duration drags every average down as the board grows.

/**
 * One day of board-wide activity — never a zero-filled calendar.
 *
 * A day nothing happened on is ABSENT from the list, the same rule the dashboard's own heatmap
 * applies (`useData.ts`'s `heatmapData`): a bar drawn at zero height for a day with no data is
 * indistinguishable from a real quiet day, so the day is simply not a member of this array at all.
 *
 * `sessionsStarted` is bucketed by each session's OWN `start_time` day (UTC, `.slice(0, 10)`, the
 * same rule `tagSessionDay` applies) — not by the day of the task that filed it, which could put a
 * session's activity on a day it never touched. `created` and `delivered` are task-level events and
 * are bucketed by the task's own `createdAt` / `deliveredAt` day for the same reason.
