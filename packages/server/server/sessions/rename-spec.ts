/**
 * rename-spec.ts — PURE. How to rename a session INSIDE its harness, and when that may be tried.
 *
 * A session can be named in two places. `pickTitle` (`harness-session-file.ts`) already settles a
 * disagreement between them; this module is the other half of the same story — making the two
 * AGREE, by carrying a rename typed in agentop through to the harness itself.
 *
 * The reverse direction has always worked: a `/rename` inside the session is written to the
 * harness's own record and read back by `harness-sessions.ts`. Only the agentop-to-harness
 * direction was missing, so a row renamed here kept whatever the harness went on calling itself,
 * and the harness's name won the moment it was the more recent of the two.
 *
 * ## Why this is a typed line and not an API call
 *
 * Three routes were tried against claude 2.1.233 on 2026-08-15 and two were REJECTED by measurement,
 * not by preference:
 *
 *   - **The messaging socket** (`messagingSocketPath` in `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, the one
 *     `events/peer-client.ts` already authenticates to). The binary does carry a control request
 *     `{subtype: 'rename_session', title}`, and it is in the accepted-subtype set — but that set
 *     belongs to the SDK's stdio transport. Sent over the peer socket with a valid token and a
 *     distinct title, the session's own record did not change: no response, no rename. That is the
 *     route this module would prefer, and it is not open.
 *   - **A CLI subcommand.** `claude --help` lists no session-rename command in 2.1.233.
 *   - **Writing the harness's own record.** Rejected on principle as well as on odds: it is another
 *     tool's private, undocumented state file, held open and rewritten by a live process on every
 *     status change, so our bytes would be overwritten within seconds while the running session went
 *     on showing the old name — a rename that reports success and did nothing.
 *
 * What is left is the interface the harness actually publishes to its user: the slash command. Read
 * from claude 2.1.233's own command table, not from memory of what it prints:
 *
 *   `name: "rename", aliases: ["name"], description: "Rename the current conversation",
 *    immediate: true, argumentHint: "[name]"`
 *
 * `immediate` is the load-bearing word — the command runs on submit rather than becoming a turn, so
 * this costs the session nothing and does not appear as work it was asked to do.
 *
 * ## Consequences of that route, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * Typing is only possible into a session agentop HOSTS. An `external` row — a harness someone
 * started beside agentop — has no pane to type into, so its harness half is skipped and SAID to be
 * skipped. Same for a row that is not running: `lost` and `exited` rows keep their agentop label and
 * nothing else, because there is no process left to tell.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, … | null>` and not a `Partial`: a harness added to `HarnessId` must fail the
 * build until someone decides, the same rule `SPAWN_SPECS`, `ATTENTION_RULES`, `APPROVAL_SPECS` and
 * `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` follow. `null` is that decision, and the five nulls here are findings —
 * each was looked for on 2026-08-15 and the result recorded on its row.

 * the agentop label alone and says so.
 *
 * Every entry below was probed on 2026-08-15 against the installed CLI:
 *
 *   claude       `/rename [name]` — in the command table, `immediate`, aliased `name`.  ✔
 *   copilot      `renameSession(name)` exists, but as an in-process SDK method on the session
 *                object. There is no channel from outside to call it, and no slash command was
 *                found in the bundle. Its file (`workspace.yaml`) is written by the live process,
 *                so the file route is the one rejected above.
 *   kimi         `state.json` carries `title` + `isCustomTitle`, and `renameSession()` exists —
 *                again as its own UI's internal call over that file. No external channel.
 *   codex        No rename anywhere in the CLI, and a rollout file records no user-facing name at
 *                all: there is nothing in codex for a rename to change.
 *   gemini       Nothing matching `rename` in the bundle.
 *   antigravity  Nothing matching `rename` in the binary.
 *
 * Four of those five are "the harness has no such thing"; copilot and kimi are "it has one and does
 * not expose it". The distinction is why each carries its own sentence rather than a shared `null`
 * with no explanation — the day one of them opens a channel, the row says what to look for.
