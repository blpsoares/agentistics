/**
 * harness-sessions.ts — the IO half of `harness-session-file.ts`: reading what each harness records
 * about its own live sessions, cheaply enough to do it every five seconds.
 *
 * ## What this buys, in order of value
 *
 *  1. **An EXACT link between a harness's own record and one of our rows.** Claude writes the tmux
 *     session it is running inside, which for a session agentop started is `agentop-<our id>`. Every
 *     other correlation in this feature has had to guess by harness-and-directory — the guess that
 *     resolved every session in one repository to the same conversation and reopened three rows onto
 *     one conversation (`session-view.ts` records that bug). Here there is nothing to guess.
 *  2. **The conversation id, exactly**, for a session we started FRESH. `ManagedSession.conversationId`
 *     is otherwise only known for a row we reopened, because we handed the id over ourselves.
 *  3. **The name the user gave the session from inside it**, which is what this was asked for.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * The poll runs every five seconds over the whole fleet, so the directory is listed once per poll and
 * each file is read only when its mtime has moved — the same shape of memo `repo-facts.ts` keeps per
 * directory. A machine with fifty stale session files pays one `readdir` and no reads at all.
 *
 * Failure is always ABSENCE. An unreadable directory, an unparseable file, a field of the wrong
 * type: the answer is "nothing is known about that session", which leaves every row exactly as it
 * behaves today. Nothing here may throw into the poll.
