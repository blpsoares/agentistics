/**
 * rename.ts — carrying a rename typed in agentop through into the harness itself.
 *
 * The decision is the pure `rename-spec.ts`; this is the part that has to touch a backend. It exists
 * as ONE function rather than as code at each call site for the reason `task-reopen.ts` exists: the
 * CLI's `agentop session rename` and the cockpit's Rename verb are the same gesture, and the last
 * time this codebase implemented one gesture twice the two drifted and only one of them was right.
 *
 * The screen is RE-READ here rather than trusted from a poll, exactly as `promptSession` does, and
 * for exactly the same reason: a session that was idle five seconds ago may be sitting on a
 * permission prompt now, where the input line is a menu and a typed `/rename` is an answer to a
 * question nobody read.
