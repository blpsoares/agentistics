/**
 * Running the transcript search — the IO edge of `transcript-search.ts`.
 *
 * Every dependency that touches the machine is injected, so the rules below are tested against
 * real behaviour rather than a mocked filesystem: what happens without `grep`, what happens with
 * no transcripts, and what happens when one harness fails while others succeed.
 *
 * ## Absence is reported, never rendered as zero
 *
 * The product's standing rule for a metric it cannot produce (`HARNESS_CAPABILITIES`, N/A rather
 * than a confident `0`) applies exactly as well to a search. "No conversation mentions this" and
 * "nothing looked" are different answers, and only one of them is a reason to stop searching. So a
 * missing `grep` and a machine with no transcripts each get their own `unavailable` reason, the
 * caller states it in words, and neither is allowed to look like an empty result set.
