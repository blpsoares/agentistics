/**
 * attachment-web.ts — attaching a file to a message sent from the dashboard.
 *
 * WHAT AN ATTACHMENT ACTUALLY IS HERE. The composer types a line into a tmux pane; there is no
 * channel through which a byte array could reach an assistant. What every one of these CLIs does
 * understand is a PATH — reading a file it is pointed at is the most ordinary thing they do. So an
 * attachment is written to this machine's disk and its path is what travels in the message.
 *
 * That is worth stating plainly in the UI too, because it is not what "attach" means in a chat
 * application: the file lands on the machine running the session, not inside the conversation.
 *
 * The write goes to ONE directory under `~/.agentistics`, which is agentop's own — the rule that
 * anything written outside its own directories is an explicit act of the user is not bent here. The
 * filename is REBUILT by the pure `attachment-name.ts` rather than sanitised, because a name from a
 * browser is attacker-controlled and joining it to a directory is how an upload becomes an
 * arbitrary write.

 * What was sent, and where to — the FALLBACK record for a `[Image #4]` marker Claude Code's OWN
 * transcript does not already answer.
 *
 * A harness that is mid-turn queues an arriving message and substitutes markers for its images, so
 * the PATH that normally survives into the transcript is gone and the chat can only draw a chip.
 * The file is still here; the link was what was missing. For Claude Code, the link is now usually
 * the harness's OWN answer: it writes a `turnCompanion` entry beside the marker turn naming exactly
 * which files it was — see `attachment-companion.ts`, resolved in `chat-tail.ts` before a turn ever
 * reaches the browser. THIS log is what a turn falls back to when that companion is missing or
 * cannot account for it exactly (an older turn from before this log existed, one whose companion did
 * not survive a truncated read window) — asked through the web's `attachmentPreview.ts`'s
 * `resolveMarkerPaths`, which sits beside the marker parsing it serves.
 *
 * APPEND-ONLY JSONL. TWO KINDS OF LINE, and the second one is the one that answers the question:
 *
 * - `AttachmentSend` — one UPLOAD, stamped when the file was written. That is the moment a person
 *   attached it, not the moment they sent it, so a turn's markers could only ever be paired with it
 *   by guessing a time window, and the guess was measurably wrong: seven uploads recorded in the
 *   hour before a message carrying four markers, three of them belonging to a message forty minutes
 *   earlier. Kept for the records already on disk and for uploads no message ever claimed.
 * - `AttachmentMessage` — one MESSAGE, stamped when it was handed to the session, carrying the very
 *   paths it named. No inference left: a marker is paired against the files of the message it came
 *   in, or against nothing.
 *
 * A line that cannot be parsed — or that is of the kind a reader does not know — is SKIPPED rather
 * than discarding the log: this is a convenience for drawing a thumbnail, and no part of the
 * product may fail because of it. That is also what makes the second kind safe to add to a file an
 * older build is still reading: it has no `path`, so that build ignores it.

 * answer must be decidable before anything is opened, and it is paired with `nosniff` on the
 * response so the browser cannot decide differently.
 *
 * IT SERVES MORE THAN IMAGES, and that was a real gap. A person can attach a PDF or a video — the
 * composer accepts both — and the gallery then showed a card saying "no preview" beside a file it
 * had itself stored, with no way to open it at all. Both are now served, each declared as exactly
 * what it is:
 *
 * - **video** is a `<video>` element's business. It is inert content: the browser decodes it, there
 *   is no document and no script.
 * - **pdf** is a document, so it is served with `Content-Disposition: inline` and viewed in the
 *   browser's own PDF viewer, under the same `default-src 'none'` policy every response here
 *   carries — the policy is what stops an embedded PDF reaching anything of ours.
 * - **svg** stays in the IMAGE row it has always been in, and its script still never runs inside an
 *   `<img>`; the CSP covers the case where somebody opens the URL directly.
 *
 * The `kind` travels with the mime because the CALLER needs it: a route that must decide between a
 * `Content-Disposition` and none, and a client that must decide between `<img>`, `<video>` and a
 * viewer. Deriving it from the mime string at each of those points would be the same table written
 * twice more.
 *
 * The set matches the browser side's `attachmentKind` deliberately — a preview the client believes
 * exists and the server refuses is a broken tile, which is the one thing the panel may not show.
