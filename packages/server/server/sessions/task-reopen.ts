/**
 * task-reopen.ts — PURE: what reopening a whole task actually does, row by row.
 *
 * Reopening a task is implemented twice — once behind `agentop session open` and once behind the
 * cockpit's verb — and the two had drifted: only one of them retired the row it was replacing, so
 * the same gesture left a different registry depending on where you pressed it. The DECISION lives
 * here and both callers perform it.
 *
 * The rules it encodes, each of which was a real defect:
 *
 *  - A row that is still RUNNING is left alone. After a reboot one session sometimes survives, and
 *    reopening the task must not spawn a second copy of it. It is reported as `already`, never as a
 *    failure — calling it a skip announces a problem where there is none.
 *  - A row already marked FINISHED is not resurrected. Ending a session is a decision, and "open
 *    the task" must not quietly undo every one of them.
 *  - A row whose conversation cannot be resolved is skipped AND counted. A partial reopen reported
 *    as a success leaves someone believing they have their whole task back.
 *  - Everything reopened RETIRES its old row. Without it a laptop closed and opened twice leaves the
 *    task holding two dead twins and one live session, all wearing the same name.
 *  - **A conversation ANOTHER live session is already driving is not opened a second time.** The
 *    rules above are all about ROWS, and rows are not the thing that gets corrupted: two rows are a
 *    tidy-up, two assistants typing into one transcript and one working tree is lost work. Measured
 *    on 2026-08-14 — five conversations were each open under two to four not-ended rows, the harness
 *    itself was printing "another Claude Code on this machine already has Remote Control for this
 *    conversation", and one of the twins stopped itself because it could see files changing under
 *    it. `liveIds` cannot see this: it is keyed by ROW, so a row that is `lost` while a DIFFERENT
 *    row drives its conversation passes every check here.
