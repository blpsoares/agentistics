/**
 * session-adopt.ts — PURE. Taking a running session BACK into the registry when its record is gone.
 *
 * `reconcileSessions` already has a name for this row: `unregistered` — the backend is running
 * `agentop-<id>` and the registry holds nothing by that id. Until now that was where the story
 * ended, and the row showed up with no harness, no directory, no label and no task, filed under
 * `GONE_PROJECT_KEY` ("no registered directory"). Every verb the cockpit offers resolves against the
 * registry, so such a row cannot be attached, renamed, filed or killed: it is visible and inert.
 *
 * ## Why a row can be running and unregistered at all
 *
 * The registry serialises writes with an IN-PROCESS queue (`registry.ts`), which is exactly as much
 * as it can promise: `agentop` runs as several processes at once — the cockpit, the daemon, and
 * every one-shot `agentop session …` — and they all read-modify-write one file. A record added by a
 * short-lived CLI process can therefore be erased by a longer-lived one that had read the file just
 * before. Measured on this machine on 2026-08-15: a takeover (`agentop session attach` on a
 * conversation id) spawned `agentop-a2b569c123`, wrote its record, and the file that survived did
 * not contain it — while nine other sessions in the same registry were intact.
 *
 * The write path is being hardened separately, and that is worth doing. It is not sufficient on its
 * own: a lost write is invisible at the moment it happens, and the session it loses is the one the
 * user is sitting in. Adoption is what makes the loss recoverable rather than permanent, and it also
 * covers the cases no write-path fix can — a registry restored from a backup, a `--corrupt`
 * quarantine, a second agentop build with its own registry.
 *
 * ## What may be adopted, and what may never be invented
 *
 * The link is the harness's OWN record naming our tmux session (`tmux: "agentop-<id>:@w.%p"` in
 * `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`), which `harness-sessions.ts` indexes as `byManagedId`. That is an
 * EXACT link, not a guess by harness-and-directory — the same distinction the rest of this module
 * family is built on.
 *
 * So a row is adopted only when such a record exists AND names a directory. Everything else is left
 * `unregistered`, deliberately: a row whose directory nobody can state would be adopted into the
 * registry as a permanent record with an invented `cwd`, and an invented cwd is what `repo-facts.ts`
 * exists to have stopped. A row left unregistered is visible and says what it is; a row adopted with
 * a made-up directory is filed under a project it was never in, and nothing on screen says so.
 *
 * The name is taken only when the harness says a PERSON chose it. A `derived` name (`aipe-46`) is
 * not a name — `harness-session-file.ts` measured 24 of 40 — and adopting one would write a label
 * the user never typed into a registry that outlives the process, where `pickTitle` would then have
 * to treat it as a deliberate choice forever.
