/**
 * task-historical.ts — PURE. A conversation filed on the BOARD with no registry row behind it, turned
 * into the read row every rollup already knows how to walk.
 *
 * See `HistoricalSession` (task-model.ts) for WHY the link lives on the board and never in the fleet
 * registry. This module is the other half: how a link becomes a row, and how a request to file one is
 * judged.
 *
 * ## The synthetic row, and where it may exist
 *
 * `historicalRows` builds a `ManagedSession`-SHAPED row (`HistoricalRow`, flagged `historical: true`)
 * so that everything that walks a task's rows — `rowsOfTask`, `distinctConversations`,
 * `conversationOwners`, the list, the detail, the overview, the stats, the sharing — inherits the
 * conversation with no per-surface code. It is built in memory, per read, from the board, and is
 * handed ONLY to those readers (`TaskWorld.rollupRows`). The fleet registry (`registryRows`,
 * `readRegistry()`) never contains one, so nothing that probes, heartbeats, reconciles, adopts,
 * attaches to or lists a session can see it.
 *
 * ## Ownership, and why `createdAt` is `linkedAt`
 *
 * `conversationOwners` decides which task a conversation belongs to by the NEWEST FILING STATEMENT
 * among its rows. A historical link is a statement made at `linkedAt`, so the row carries that as
 * `createdAt` and the existing rule does the rest, with no special case:
 *
 *  - it OVERRIDES an older registry filing on another task (filing is a MOVE);
 *  - it is overridden by a LATER registry filing (the person re-filed the reopened conversation);
 *  - a reopen that carries no `taskId` says nothing about the id and is ignored, exactly as it is
 *    for two registry rows, so a reopened conversation stays where it was filed;
 *  - on an exact tie the row appended LAST wins (`atLeastAsNew` falls back to array order), and
 *    `historicalRows` is appended after the registry — the link was written after the rows it saw.
 *
 * A registry row's `createdAt` is when it was MINTED, not when it was last filed (`attachSession`
 * patches the same row), so against a registry row the comparison is a lower bound on that row's
 * statement — the same limit `conversationOwners` already lives with between two registry rows.
 * Refusing to file a conversation the fleet already holds (`conversation_in_fleet`) keeps the two
 * kinds of row from meeting in the first place; the read side stays correct when they do.
