/**
 * crash-group.ts — PURE. Which sessions FELL TOGETHER, so all of them can be picked back up at once.
 *
 * A reboot, an OOM kill or a `tmux kill-server` takes the whole backend at once: every managed
 * session reconciles to `lost` in the same instant, keeping its name, its note and its task. Getting
 * them all back is one gesture, and this decides what "them all" means.
 *
 * ## The hard part is not the grouping, it is the garbage
 *
 * A registry that keeps a row for everything it ever started will happily hand you fifty `lost`
 * sessions, of which three actually fell — the other forty-seven were over days ago. A group like
 * that is a list of everything that has ever existed, and it cannot be reopened without reading
 * every row first, which is the whole of the work this is meant to remove.
 *
 * So membership needs evidence that a session was ALIVE when the machine went down, and no such
 * evidence existed: `createdAt` says when it started (a session opened three weeks ago and abandoned
 * has one just the same), and `BackendSession.lastActivityMs` only exists for a session the backend
 * still knows about — which is precisely not the case for one that fell. The registry therefore
 * records `lastSeenMs`, stamped when a session is created and refreshed by the poller's heartbeat.
 *
 * The heartbeat writes ONE timestamp for EVERY session alive at that moment, in a single write. That
 * is what makes the clustering exact rather than fuzzy: sessions that died together do not merely
 * have nearby `lastSeenMs`, they have the same one. The window below exists only to absorb the gap
 * between a session created since the last heartbeat (stamped at creation) and its older siblings
 * (stamped at the heartbeat), which is at most one interval — hence the invariant that the window is
 * wider than the heartbeat, asserted in the tests.
 *
 * ## Which way this errs, and why
 *
 * Two errors are possible, and they do not cost the same:
 *
 *  - **Admitting garbage** makes the group useless. It is the failure that was asked for by name,
 *    and it is silent: a group of forty rows looks exactly like a correct group of forty rows.
 *  - **Leaving out a session that really fell** costs one keypress. The row is still on the screen,
 *    still named, and still carries its own `Reopen` verb — which is what recovers it today.
 *
 * So every rule here errs toward EXCLUDING. In particular there is no fallback when `lastSeenMs` is
 * absent: a registry written by an older build, or a row this process never once saw alive, is not
 * in the group. It will join the next one, because the heartbeat stamps it as soon as it is seen.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT a rule
 *
 *  - **No minimum size.** One session open when the laptop died is one session that fell, and the
 *    heading states the count and the time, so a group of one claims nothing a group of six does not.
 *  - **No maximum age.** A fall from three days ago that was never picked up is still the sessions
 *    that fell. The UI says WHEN, so "three days ago" is never mistaken for "just now".
 *  - **No requirement that the conversation be resolvable.** That is `planTaskReopen`'s business, and
 *    it already reports an unresolvable row as skipped AND counted. Filtering here instead would make
 *    the group quietly smaller than the fall it describes.
