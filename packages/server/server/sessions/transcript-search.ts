/**
 * SEARCHING WHAT WAS SAID — the local half, and the reason it is local.
 *
 * A previous attempt (`3e9f06c`, reverted) put the conversation text on `SessionMeta` as
 * `transcript_text` so the browser could filter it client-side. That is the one place it must
 * never go: `SessionMeta` is what `team-uploader.ts` serialises whole into a member's push, and
 * `redactSessionText` covers `first_prompt`/`title`/`user_label`/`user_note` and nothing else — so
 * up to 200 KB of unredacted conversation crossed the wire to the central, against the standing
 * guarantee that members never push chat. It also did not work: the field was only written when a
 * transcript happened to be re-parsed, so on a real machine 1 session of 140 carried one and a
 * search for `docker` found nothing in a corpus holding it 317 times.
 *
 * So the text is never carried anywhere. It is READ, on the machine that owns it, at the moment
 * someone asks, and only an id comes back. Nothing here reaches the web dashboard or a central.
 *
 * ## Why `grep` and not a read loop
 *
 * Measured on this machine — 912 files, 475 MB under `~/.claude/projects`:
 *
 *   - `grep` through `Bun.spawn`, argv array:  255 ms
 *   - reading every file with `Bun.file().text()` and `.includes()`:  3–5 s
 *
 * Twenty times the cost is the difference between a search that runs while you type and one you
 * wait for, so the read loop is not a simpler alternative — it is a different feature.
 *
 * ## The query is DATA
 *
 * `Bun.spawn` takes an argv ARRAY, so no shell parses anything, and `--` terminates the option
 * list so a query of `-r` is a string to look for rather than a flag to obey. Both are asserted in
 * `transcript-search.test.ts` against the hostile inputs, because "we do not use a shell" is a
 * property that a later refactor to `Bun.$` would quietly remove.
