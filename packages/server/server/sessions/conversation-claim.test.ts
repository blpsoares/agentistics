/**
 * The real pairs, from `~/.agentistics/managed-sessions.json` on 2026-08-14.
 *
 * Five conversations were each recorded against two to four NOT-ENDED rows. Reading two of the
 * screens side by side showed identical text — one conversation, two assistants typing into it — and
 * Claude Code itself was printing "another Claude Code on this machine already has Remote Control
 * for this conversation". The pair below is kept verbatim because the DIRECTORIES are the tell: they
 * differ, so nothing matched these two rows by directory. Both carried the same recorded
 * conversation id, which is exactly the evidence this module is built on.
