 * statuses, renamed labels, chosen colours, deletion of the ones nobody uses — so it is now a plain
 * `string`, validated at WRITE time (`markTask` / `patchSubtask`, below and in `task-web.ts`)
 * against the board's own `TaskBook.statuses` list rather than against a type the compiler can
 * check. See `@agentistics/core`'s `taskStatus.ts` for the list itself, its migration, and the four
 * ids (`PROTECTED_STATUS_IDS`) several rules in THIS file still compare against by exact string:
 *
 *  `todo`        — queued, nothing started. PROTECTED.
 *  `in_progress` — something is running or a session has touched it. PROTECTED.
 *  `blocked`     — it CANNOT proceed. Distinct from `todo` on purpose: "nobody picked it up" and
 *                  "somebody tried and cannot" are different facts, and only the second is a
 *                  problem to go and solve. PROTECTED.
 *  `done`        — DELIVERED. This is the state that closes rounds-to-delivery and stamps
 *                  `deliveredAt`; there is exactly one, so the metric cannot be ambiguous. PROTECTED.
 *
 * `backlog`, `in_review` and `abandoned` are the three words this board also shipped with — kept
 * working as ordinary, ordinary NON-protected statuses (a machine already using one of them keeps
 * using it; see `planStatusMigration`), and everything past those seven is whatever a person has
