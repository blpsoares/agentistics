/**
 * conversation-claim.ts — PURE. Which conversations are being driven RIGHT NOW, and by what.
 *
 * This exists because of the worst thing the session manager has done: it opened the SAME
 * CONVERSATION in two terminals at once. Measured on this machine on 2026-08-14 — five conversations
 * were recorded against two to four not-ended registry rows each, one of them four times:
 *
 *   cd118e71…  44d649269a  .../worktrees/parse-cache-sqlite
 *              1da098e5cb  /home/mithrandir/agentistics
 *   03fa293a…  1ec25fc3d1  .../worktrees/cockpit-remount-flash
 *              e477d4e628  /home/mithrandir/agentistics
 *
 * Reading the two screens side by side showed identical text: one conversation, two assistants
 * typing into it. Claude Code itself notices and says so —
 *
 *   Remote Control not started here · another Claude Code on this machine
 *   (started 16s ago) already has Remote Control for this conversation
 *
 * — so the HARNESS knew and agentop, which started both, did not. It is not a display problem: the
 * two write to one transcript and to one working tree. The parse-cache session stopped itself, wrote
 * that somebody else was editing the same files, and declined to dispatch its next agent. It was
 * right, and the somebody was its own twin.
 *
 * ## Only EXACT evidence counts, and that is the whole design
 *
 * There are three ways to say which conversation a row drives, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *  1. the harness's own record (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, matched by tmux session name or by
 *     pid) — a FACT, written by the process about itself;
 *  2. the id the registry stored while the session was up — a recollection, but an exact one;
 *  3. harness-and-directory inference — a GUESS, and the one that cannot tell two sessions of one
 *     repository apart.
 *
 * A lock built on (3) is a lock that jams: every session in a repository resolves to the same
 * conversation, so the second reopen in any repo would be refused forever, and people would learn to
 * work around the door rather than through it. So only (1) and (2) are ever admitted here — the same
 * line `session-view.ts` already draws between `metricsOf` (exact only) and `claimResume` (may
 * guess). The cost is stated plainly: a twin created without either kind of record is invisible to
 * this module and is not prevented. Refusing on a guess would be worse.
 *
 * ## Alive, not merely known
 *
 * The harness's records OUTLIVE their processes — 53 files on this machine against about a dozen live
 * ones. A conversation is therefore in use only when the row holding it is ALIVE, and the caller says
 * which those are. Reading the records alone would refuse to reopen anything that ever ran.
 */

/**
 * What kind of thing is holding a conversation.
 *
 * The distinction the lock was missing. `managed` is a row agentop hosts: it has a tmux pane you can
 * attach to, so "go and use it" is a real instruction. `process` is an assistant nobody here
 * started — one opened by hand, or a background agent — and for that one "go and use it" is not an
 * instruction at all: there is no pane to attach to, and the refusal named its DIRECTORY, which is
 * not somewhere you can go. It was a dead end, and it was the only thing on offer.
 *
 * A `process` holder is therefore not a refusal any more, it is a takeover: the conversation lives
 * on disk, so ending that process and reopening the SAME id under tmux loses nothing but the turn in
 * flight and puts the work back under every verb this screen has.
