/**
 * repo-facts.ts — which REPOSITORY a directory belongs to, and whether it is a linked worktree.
 *
 * A session is opened in a directory, but the thing a person thinks in is the repository: three
 * worktrees of `agentistics` are three places to work on ONE project, and a list that files them
 * under `session-monitor`, `billing-basis` and `agentistics` has taken the one grouping that
 * matches how the work is organised and split it into three.
 *
 * The identity is the git REMOTE wherever there is one, because that is the only key a worktree
 * provably shares with its main checkout — the directory names deliberately differ, and the
 * toplevel of a linked worktree is the worktree itself. With no remote it falls back to the
 * COMMON git dir's parent, which is the main checkout even when asked from inside a worktree.
 *
 * ## A directory that is GONE is not a directory that is not in a repository
 *
 * `ExitWorktree --remove`, `git worktree remove` and an ordinary `rm -rf` all leave the session
 * registered at a path that no longer names anything. Every `git -C <gone>` then fails, the facts
 * come back empty, and the grouping falls through to the last path segment — so the deleted
 * worktree `.claude/worktrees/member-connect-rotate` appeared on screen as a PROJECT of its own,
 * standing beside `Agentistics`, which is the project it was a worktree of. A folder name is a
 * guess, and inventing a project from a path that resolves to nothing is the same error as
 * reporting a confident `0` for a metric a harness cannot produce.
 *
 * So the discriminator is whether the DIRECTORY EXISTS, not whether git answered:
 *  - it exists and git named a repo  → that, live;
 *  - the session RECORDED its repo when it started → that, and it is the only fact left;
 *  - it exists and nothing names a repo → not in a repository, and its own folder name is real;
 *  - it is gone and nothing was recorded → `missing`, said in WORDS by the UI and never grouped
 *    under a name derived from the path.
 *
 * ## What may be memoized, and what may not
 *
 * A POSITIVE answer is permanent: a directory does not change repository, and the fleet poller runs
 * every five seconds over every session, so asking git three times per session per tick is a hundred
 * processes a minute to learn the same thing. A NEGATIVE one is not a fact about the directory, it
 * is a fact about this MOMENT — the worktree had been removed, or git was briefly unavailable — and
 * caching it for the life of the process meant a cwd probed once while absent stayed repo-less
 * forever, even after `agentop session open` or `git worktree add` put it back. Negatives therefore
 * expire (`NEGATIVE_TTL_MS`), which costs one re-probe a minute for a directory genuinely outside a
 * repository, and nothing at all for one that is missing — that case never spawns git.

 * better than falling back to the folder name. `missing` is reported independently of it, because
