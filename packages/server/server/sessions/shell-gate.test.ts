 * A raw shell is strictly more powerful than the chat, which `chat-gate.ts` already calls the most
 * powerful thing this server does — the chat at least spawns a NAMED assistant CLI, while this
 * spawns whatever the person types. So it takes the same two gates.
 *
 * OWNER DECISION, 2026-09-14: Shell now ships ON BY DEFAULT — an absent preference reads as ON
 * (subject to `capable`), reversing the strict reading this file pinned before. The SECURITY gate
 * (`capable`) is exactly as strict as it always was; only the reading of an unset PREFERENCE
 * changed. See `shell-gate.ts`'s own header for the full reasoning.
