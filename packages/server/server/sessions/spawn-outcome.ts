/**
 * spawn-outcome.ts — PURE. Did the thing we just started actually START?
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for, reported and reproduced
 *
 * A conversation was showing as `closed` while it was in fact running as a background agent. Every
 * press of Reopen spawned `claude --resume <id>`, and Claude Code REFUSED — the conversation was
 * already open elsewhere:
 *
 * ```
 * Session 581deab7-… is currently running as a background agent (bg).
 * Use `claude agents` to find and attach to it, or add --fork-session to branch off a copy.
 * Pane is dead (status 1, Sat Aug 15 01:31:03 2026)
 * ```
 *
 * The spawn "succeeded" — tmux created the session, the call returned — so a row was written. The
 * program inside had already exited. Pressing Reopen again made another one. The user finished with
 * **three rows called MAIN**, all dead, and the real conversation still not opened.
 *
 * **`spawn` returning without throwing is not evidence that anything is running.** tmux's contract
 * is "I made you a session", not "your program is alive"; with `remain-on-exit on` — which agentop
 * sets deliberately, so a crash can be read instead of vanishing — a dead pane looks exactly like a
 * live one to `list()`. The screen is the only thing that knows.
 *
 * ## What is read, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * `Pane is dead` is tmux's own words for "your program exited", and it carries the status. That is
 * the DECISION. Everything above it is the program's last words, and they are what the user needs —
 * "it did not start" is not actionable, "it refused because the conversation is already open" is.
 *
 * The message is never interpreted, only carried. A harness may refuse for reasons nobody here has
 * seen, and inventing a category for each would be a table that goes stale in silence; passing the
 * words through is correct for every refusal, including the ones that do not exist yet.

 * the real refusal on this machine:
 *
 * ```
 *  300ms  pane empty
 *  700ms  pane empty          ← a 700ms check reports "started" and writes the row
 * 1500ms  two lines, alive
 * 3000ms  dead
 * ```
 *
 * The harness loads, resolves the conversation, and only then refuses. A guessed timeout would have
 * missed the exact case this exists for while looking like it worked.
 *
 * Paired with `POLL_MS`: the wait ENDS the moment the pane dies, so a refusal costs about as long as
 * it takes, and only a healthy session pays the full deadline — which is why `batch` runs its checks
 * in one parallel pass rather than serially.
