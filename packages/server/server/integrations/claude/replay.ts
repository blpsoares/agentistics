/**
 * integrations/claude/replay.ts — PURE. A Claude Code transcript, read as canonical events.
 *
 * The shape is `jsonl.ts`'s own: `emptyClaudeReplay` / `foldClaudeReplay` / `finishClaudeReplay`,
 * every accumulator moving only forward, so folding a transcript in one call and in N uneven chunks
 * emits the same events — the property `transcript-cursor.ts` needs to resume a live file from a
 * byte offset instead of re-reading it (CLAUDE.md, "A LIVE transcript is read by what it has
 * WRITTEN SINCE LAST TIME"). The IO half is `./index.ts`.
 *
 * Three sub-folds, one per concern, each in its own module:
 * - `replay-agents.ts` — the session, the run and the agents: when each started and ended, and the
 *   subagents the `subagents/` directory says existed (`subagent-join.ts`).
 * - `replay-model.ts` — one `model.invoked` + `model.completed` per billed response, keyed on
 *   `message.id`, emitted ONCE with its FINAL usage (see that module: the journal keeps the FIRST
 *   row per id, so an early partial would be the one kept).
 * - `replay-tools.ts` — one `tool.requested` per `tool_use` block, one `tool.completed` /
 *   `tool.failed` per result.
 *
 * The fold never collects events: it hands each one to `emit` as it is made, so the caller decides
 * how many to hold (P1 §9 — no unbounded accumulation). `lineNo` is 1-based and counts EVERY raw
 * line, blanks included, exactly as `foldClaudeParse` counts them, so the sink `jsonl.ts` offers and
 * this fold's own line reader name the same record by the same number.
