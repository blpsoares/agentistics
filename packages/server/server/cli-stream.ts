/**
 * cli-stream.ts — the control center's OUTPUT CHANNEL: a long command's bytes, as pane lines.
 *
 * The commands whose output is the point — `docker compose up --build`, `central.sh up`, `bun run
 * bin` — used to run under `suspend`: the app left the alternate screen, the child inherited the
 * real tty, and the user pressed Enter to come back. They now run INSIDE the interface, streaming
 * into a framed pane, which is only possible if nothing they produce reaches the terminal directly.
 * So every one of them is spawned with BOTH pipes captured and never `inherit`.
 *
 * This module is the impure half of that: it owns the subscriber set, the read loops, and the spawn
 * helper. Everything it decides about the BYTES is in `@agentistics/tui/control/stream`, which is
 * pure and tested — the carriage-return collapsing, the escape stripping, the chunk-boundary
 * buffering and the ring bound all live there.
 *
 * It is imported statically by `cli-start.ts` and `cli-central.ts`, so it deliberately imports the
 * TUI's stream module by its own subpath rather than through `@agentistics/tui/control`: that entry
 * pulls in Ink and React, which have no business being loaded by `agentop central logs`.
