# Running work in parallel with agentop

\`agentop\` runs assistant CLIs as background sessions (tmux-backed, so they survive this
conversation ending) and files them under a named task. It is what lets you hand independent pieces
of work to several assistants at once instead of doing them one after another in this session.

Harnesses this machine can start: **${list}**.

## When this applies

Reach for it when the work in front of you is genuinely independent — different repositories,
different packages, a migration per file, one reviewer per subsystem — and each piece is big enough
to be worth its own assistant (roughly: more than a few minutes of work, and no shared state to
coordinate). Ordinary sequential work, anything needing the user in the loop step by step, and
anything you can simply do here does NOT belong in a batch.

## The rule that comes first

**Never start a session without the user's explicit go-ahead.** Propose the split, show the exact
prompts, say how many assistants that is, and wait. Each session is a separate assistant burning its
own tokens; N sessions is roughly N times the cost, and nobody authorised that by asking a question.
If the user says "just do it", that is the go-ahead — take it and run.

## How to propose

State it compactly and completely, so approving it is one word:

> Three independent pieces here. I'd run them as parallel sessions under the task \`auth-refactor\`:
>
> 1. \`${first}\` in \`~/app\` — "refactor the token store to …"
> 2. \`${second}\` in \`~/app\` — "port the tests in packages/api to …"
> 3. \`${first}\` in \`~/docs\` — "update the auth docs to match …"
>
> Start them?

## How to start them

One command, all of them, filed under one task:

\`\`\`bash
agentop session batch --task "auth-refactor" --cwd ~/app --json \\
  --session "${first}: refactor the token store so tokens are hashed at rest; keep the public API" \\
  --session "${second}@~/app/packages/api: port the token tests to the new store" \\
  --session "${first}@~/docs: update the auth page to describe hashed-at-rest tokens"
\`\`\`

- \`--task\` is required and groups the sessions. \`agentop session open "auth-refactor"\` brings the
  whole task back later — including after a reboot.
- \`--cwd\`, \`--model\` and \`--effort\` before the sessions are defaults for all of them; \`@<path>\`
  on a session overrides the directory for that one.
- \`--json\` prints the started ids as data. Read them from there rather than parsing the prose.
- Every session starts DETACHED. A batch has no single terminal to hand over.
- A session that fails to start does not abort the rest; the JSON reports \`started\` and \`failed\`
  separately. Report both — four that started are four that are running.

### Writing each session's prompt

The prompt is the whole briefing. That session cannot see this conversation, cannot ask you a
question, and cannot see what the others are doing. So each one needs: what to change, where, what
"done" looks like, and what NOT to touch (name the files the other sessions own, so two assistants
do not edit the same file). Prefer one paragraph of plain instruction over a checklist of
one-liners. Keep the sessions in different directories — or at least different files — wherever the
work allows it.

## After starting

\`\`\`bash
agentop session list --json     # id, status, activity, task, cwd for the whole fleet
agentop session attach <id>     # hand the terminal to one of them (the user does this)
agentop session kill <id>       # stop one
agentop session open "<task>"   # reopen every session of a task, later
\`\`\`

\`activity\` is what a session is doing: \`working\`, \`waiting\`, \`waiting-approval\` (it is blocked on
a permission prompt and needs a person), \`exited\`. Tell the user which ones need them; do not
attach on their behalf — attaching takes over the terminal.

## What this is not

It does not make the other assistants report back to you. They work in their own sessions; the user
reads them with \`agentop session attach\` or the cockpit (\`agentop\` → the **sessions** tab). Your
job ends at proposing the split, writing the prompts, starting the batch, and saying what is running
where.
