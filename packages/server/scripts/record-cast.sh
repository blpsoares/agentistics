# record-cast.sh — record one asciinema cast of an interactive agentop screen.
#
# The control center and the TUI are full-screen Ink applications: they need a
# real pty and they must be driven by keystrokes, which `asciinema rec -c` alone
# cannot do. So the program runs inside a detached tmux session, keys are sent to
# it from outside, and asciinema records a READ-ONLY attach to that session — the
# recording therefore captures exactly what a user would see, with no recorder
# chrome and no stray input of our own.
#
# Usage:
#   record-cast.sh <name> <cols> <rows> <command> [-- <key> <delay-ms> ...]
#
#   record-cast.sh control 120 34 "agentop start" -- Right 1200 Right 1200 q 400
#
# Output: $OUT_DIR/<name>.cast   (OUT_DIR defaults to ./casts)
#
# Env:
#   OUT_DIR      where the .cast lands
#   HOME_DIR     HOME for the recorded program (use a demo home — never your own)
#   EXTRA_ENV    extra "K=V K=V" passed to the recorded program
#   SETTLE_MS    wait after start before the first key (default 2500)
#   TAIL_MS      wait after the last key before stopping (default 1500)

# A fixed size is what keeps every cast in a set visually consistent; the Ink
# screens lay themselves out from it, so it must be set before the program runs.
#
# The pane runs a BARE shell (--noprofile --norc) with a neutral prompt. The
# operator's own prompt is the leak nobody thinks about: a themed prompt puts the
# host, the cwd, the git branch and — with the common work setups — an e-mail
# address on screen, and it reappears the moment the recorded program exits. A
# published GIF cannot be taken back, so the prompt is replaced, not trusted.
#
# The demo HOME, the ports and the binary's directory all go on the SESSION's
# shell, never on the command we type. Two reasons, both of them things that end
# up in a published file: the pane inherits the tmux server's environment, so
# setting HOME anywhere else leaves the recorded program reading the operator's
# real config; and a typed `env HOME=/home/<user>/… /home/<user>/…/agentop start`
# puts that user's name and directory layout on screen for the first seconds of
# every recording. What gets typed is just `agentop start`.
