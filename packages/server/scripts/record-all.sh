# record-all.sh — record the full set of terminal casts for the README and site.
#
# Every cast runs against a DEMO machine home built by seed-demo.ts, never your
# own: the recordings are published, and a real project name or repository in one
# cannot be taken back. Build the fleet first:
#
#   bun run packages/server/scripts/seed-demo.ts --split 3 --force
#   HOME=~/.agentistics-demo-home-1 PORT=47391 ./release/agentop server &
#
# Then:  packages/server/scripts/record-all.sh
#
# Output: casts/*.cast (embed with asciinema-player) and casts/*.gif (README).
#
# Env: DEMO_HOME (default ~/.agentistics-demo-home-1), DEMO_PORT (47391),
#      AGENTOP (./release/agentop), OUT_DIR (./casts).
